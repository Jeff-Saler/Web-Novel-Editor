# Web-Novel-Editor

The typical simplified path for an author is usually to; write the book, edit it, then publish it. While this is still a tried and true method, and although e-books have shortened the gap, in this era of internet connectivity there is a new format for authors to have readers access their works.  They are called Web Novels.  In China, many fiction books especially sci-fi, fantasy, martial arts, and romance novels are now being published directly to the web.  Instead of compiling a whole book to be released, authors instead write and release a single chapter, usually fairly short, on some sort of daily or weekly release schedule.  In my opinion this is, by far, a better way.  It's like comparing Night of the Living Dead to The Walking Dead.

There is one problem that faces many web novel enthusiasts.  Someone who does not speak the language of origin has to wait for chapters to be translated.  One would think, 'Why not just use Google Translate'.  Machine Translation is a path that many readers have tried.  The problem is; machine translators currently available on the internet are purposed. Whether for conversational translations that will focus on day to day language use, or for business translations that will focus on trade; there is no machine translator that can capture the nuance and flow of a novel.  It would be like running the Lord of the Rings through Google Translate, you'll get a translation but it wont have that special something that turns words into a story.

As an avid web novel enthusiast and a data scientist, I decided it was time to put a stop to this.  I decided to make a new form of machine translator that will not only take web novels from their language of origin to English, but also edit and stylize the output to make the robotic descriptive.
