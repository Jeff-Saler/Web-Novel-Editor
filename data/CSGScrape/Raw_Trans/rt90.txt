Chapter 90: God's Imperial Sword Shows Supernatural PowerIn the dusty time of the sword dust, the small head of the golden silver serpent lined with a large mouth that was completely incompatible with its body and once again bitten toward the neck of the sword dust, and the gray teeth of the venom on the sharp teeth. The flow is.I found the mouth of the gold silver snake biting, the head of the sword dust immediately to the side of a side, escaped the mouth of the gold silver snake bite like his neck, and then stepped out again and again, to the gold wire Behind the serpent, the light breeze sword in the hand carries a strong Jianmang, and it is not faithful to stab again at the seven-inch place of the golden silk silver serpent.The breeze sword accurately pierces the seven inches of the golden silver thread snake, but when the tip of the sword touches the outer layer of skin seven inches away, it can no longer move forward. This thin layer of golden skin seems to be an invincible fortress, which makes it impossible for the sword dust to strike a trace on it.After seeing this scene, Jian Chen’s face became more and more severe, and his mood sank completely with the effect of this sword. The strong defense force of the golden silver snake made the sword dust basically Helplessly, his strong attack in front of the strong defense of the gold silver thread serpent, put the Buddha is scratching like a child, simply did not create the slightest damage to him.Jian Chen did not hesitate at all, he immediately recovered the light wind sword, his feet forced a trip to the ground, when the gold silver snake did not reflect over, his body has been high in the air, after the direction, the feet Constant leveraging on the trunk, flew toward the depths of the Mountain of Warcraft.This powerful defense force of the golden silver thread snake makes the sword dust simply unable to kill it, so the sword dust only flew to the depths of the mountains of Warcraft, hoping to meet a fierce point of Warcraft to the gold wire silver snake Entangled in the only way, he can get out of the smooth, although this will take great risks, but in addition, Jian Chen have no other way.Although the swordsman's heart clearly into the Warcraft Mountains mercenaries must be a lot, perhaps with their hands to hold the gold silk silver snake, but the Warcraft is really too big, in order to meet some mercenaries, are A very difficult thing.Dust dust body in midair, feet on both sides of the trunk as a lever point, quickly flew toward the depths of the mountains of Warcraft, and behind him, only the thickness of the silver wire snake snakes, in the mouth The tongue apricot is constantly swallowed, and the body standing in the air is six or seven meters in length.The body of the silver wire snake is very long, and its body size is completely out of proportion. At least until now, sword dust has not yet seen the whole body of the golden silver wire snake body, but according to his estimation, the gold wire is in front of him. The silver serpent's body length is at least 50 meters.The path of the sword dust has always maintained a s-shaped trajectory, along the way are selected as much as possible in the direction of obstacles, in order to block the pursuit of gold silver snake.    "Roar!"Suddenly, a tiger hum came from a short distance, the sound quickly approaching the sword dust, and soon after, I saw a black tiger with a body length of three meters appears in the dust of the sword, a tiger full of fierce Staring at the sword dust, however, when the black tiger was about to be swept away like a sword dust, there was a wrist with only the thickness of the wrist. The golden snake that was exposed to the air and was 6.7 meters long was in the eyes of the black tiger.When the golden snake was seen, the black tiger was electrocuted and the hair roots were raised. The eyes that were originally full of fierce light shrank in an instant and looked into the eyes of the golden silver serpent. Fear, and then did not dare to stay here for a moment, immediately fled with his tail to escape here.Although the Silver Wire Snake is a snake, even if they are placed in the Warcraft group, there are few World of Warcraft dare to offend them.This situation was staged many times in the Mountain of Warcraft, along the way, Jian Chen also met a lot of World of Warcraft, but when these World of Warcraft saw the gold silver thread snake behind him, it immediately scared butt urine slip Did not dare to call, sneaked away with his tail, and no one dared to challenge the back of the only gold-silver thread snake.After half an hour, the sword dust has approached the depths of the Mountain of Warcraft, where the jungle is getting more and more lush, so that the advance of the sword dust has been greatly hindered, and behind it, the gold silver snake is still tight Responding, it seems to have identified a sword dust like, even though a lot of Warcraft encountered on the road, but it is in hot pursuit of sword dust."Smith!" The silver serpent's head was marked as a remnant of shadow, once again biting toward the sword dust.Jian Chen always pay attention to the situation behind him, his feet immediately on the side of the trunk on a hard pull, the whole body flying toward the side to escape, escaped the gold silver snake attack.See Jian dust repeatedly evaded his attack, gold silver snake seems to be angry, a pair of small eyes flashing dangerous light, then a long golden tail stretch out from the weeds, with extremely fast The speed of the sword toward the dust.Jian Chen’s face changed slightly. At this time, his body was just next to a stout big tree. The sword dust did not hesitate, his feet once again saw a big tree, and the whole body accelerated to a long distance ahead. The crisp sword sounds are transmitted from the breeze sword.
