The first chapter sword dust In a vast and endless range of mountains, two sword-shaped peaks with a thousand feet high stand 100 meters apart under a sea of ​​clouds	['', '[] []', 'Chapter 1: Jian Chen', '', 'Within a seemingly endless chain of mountain ranges, there were two sword-shaped mountain peaks well over a thousand feet tall and a hundred meters apart from each other as it towered under the vast ocean of clouds
The two sword-shaped peaks are very steep, and they look like two enlarged versions of the Excalibur inserted between heaven and earth	', 'Both of these sword-shaped mountains were extremely precipitous and looked as if two gods had once stabbed their swords into the world
There is no place for rock climbing	 No matter where one looked, there was no way to climb up these mountains
At the summit of these two sword-shaped peaks, it is only less than a hundred meters from the vast sea of ​​clouds in the sky	', 'At the very top of these peaks, there was only less than a hundred meters between one peak to the next
At the peak of the mountain, there is a faint fog and fog, and it is covered by fog, making the peak of the mountain The scenes of the monks are all foolish and ambiguous	 There was a faint amount of fog that hampered the visibility of the area to a confusing degree
However, vaguely, they can still be found on the top of two sword-shaped mountains	 However, despite the hazy visibility, one would still be able to faintly make out two people standing at the very top of the mountain peaks calmly and motionlessly as if they were stone statues
Two people are standing there silently, as if they were a stone statue, and they will not move	 Only their clothes and wind had fluttered with the fierce gale of wind that blew across the sky
Only the bleak winds in the sky were blowing on the clothes of the two men and the hair was floating in the wind	', 'Between these two people, one of them was a youth that was no older than 20 years old
Among them, one of them seems to be just a youth younger than 20 years old	 This youth was incredibly handsome with a flawless facial appearances
The young man is very handsome and his handsome features are flawless	 It could be said that his appearances was simply unrivaled throughout the world and was a natural lady killer
It is truly unique and it is the killer of all young girls in the world	 His rather ordinary-looking eyes contained a unique amount attractiveness and fascination to them and seemed as if it could steal the soul of whomever
A pair of bland eyes has a unique attraction, very charming, as if you can breathe	', 'The youth had long black hair with a length that reached his waist without being tied up in any way, allowing it to float freely in the fierce wind as if it was dancing
The young man has a long black hair and goes straight to his waist	 On his back was a single long sword that was wrapped up in a thick white layer of cloth
His long hair is not bound by any restraint	 On the exquisite sword hilt that stuck out from the cloth, one could make out the two words “Light Wind”
He is arbitrarily dressed and flutters with the roaring winds	 What was most puzzling about the sword however was the fact that there had been no ropes binding it to the youth at all
On the young man's back, he carries a long sword	 It seemed as if it was stuck to the back of the youth without any chance of falling–clearly a very hard display to explain
The sword of the sword was wrapped in a thick layer of white cloth	', 'This youth’s name was Jian Chen, the number one expert with a name that shook the Heavens and the Jianghu with the moniker of “Sword God”
Only an exquisite hilt on the outside could be seen	 His quick sword techniques had long since reached perfection and could be considered the sword master of the generation
On the hilt, the word “light breeze” was clearly engraved	 Despite being only 20 or so years old, he had already reached a realm of great heights
However, it was strange	', 'The details regarding Jian Chen were relatively unknown to the people of the Jianghu
The fact is that the whole sword of the sword did not have any ropes	 Aside from that he was an orphan with no affiliations to any school or sect, there was nothing else known about him
It seemed as if it was sucking on the back of the young people	 His history was essentially a riddle, and the strong style of martial arts and the exquisite sword style he used had been an utter mystery on where to learn it
It did not fall down	', 'And on the other sword-shaped peak a hundred meters away was a single large man wearing black robes
This scene seems obviously difficult to understand	 This was an elderly man who looked to be around 50 to 60 years old with hair that was tied up in the same fashion of the neck of a crane
This young man is called Jian Chen, and now the first master in the arena of the rivers and lakes is known as the title of the sword god	 Both of his elderly eyes lit up with a lively spirit that seemed to shine with a light that lit up the entire area
It is a master of swordsmanship, and the first-hand quick swordsmanship method has already achieved supernatural power and has reached the ultimate goal	 His gaze had been like a sharp sword that would make anyone unwilling to look straight at him
However, his age is only in his twenties	 In his hand was a black and thick long sword
For the sword dust, the people in the rivers and lakes know very little	 But what was most surprising was that this giant sword had no edge to it
In addition to knowing that he is an orphan and there is no school, the others have nothing to know	', 'This elderly man was the legendary figure that had disappeared from the Jianghu over a hundred years ago: Dugu Qiubai
His origins are like a mystery	 But that was only a nickname of his since no one had any idea on what his true name or identity was
No one knows how to learn from high-strength martial arts and the exquisite swordsmanship	 The reason for this was because over a hundred years ago, he had defeated every single ‘unparalleled’ super-experts
And on the sword-shaped mountain peak 100 meters away from him, a tall man dressed in a black robe stood there, far from sword dust	 Nowadays, the amount of people that knew anything about Dugu Qiubai and were still alive were far and few
This man was an old man, and he looked like he was 50 or 60 years old	 But even now, the splendid light he had cast in his former days had been passed on from generation to generation
The appearance of the child, Hefa Tong Yan, a pair of old eyes and gods, Jingmang eyes, that sharp eyes like a sharp sword, people dare not look at him, and in his hands, holding a generous black giant The sword, but what makes people feel weird is that his great sword is actually not edged	 A hundred years later, his strength was surely much stronger than before; meaning that there was no one that knew just how strong Dugu Qiubai had become
This old man is a legendary figure that has disappeared for hundreds of years in the rivers and lakes - the defeat of Tokgo, and the defeat of Tokgo is just his title	', 'Silently, Dugu Qiubai stared at the 20 or so years old Jian Chen from a hundred meters away
No one knows his real name and identity, because as early as a hundred years ago, he It is a super strong player who fights invincible in the world	 His eyes were extremely terrifying and seemed to contain a sharp sword-like glare that seemed as if it could freeze someone at times
Nowadays, people who know some information about the defeat of Tok Go is still very rare in the world	', '“Jian Chen, despite being so young, you have a strength that is no weaker than mine
However, his brilliant brilliance is still He was passed down from generation to generation, and today his strength is better than it was a century ago	 Your achievements in the way of the sword is something that even I can only hope to attain
Nowadays, no one knows what the strength of Tokgo's defeat has reached	 But unfortunately, you’ve killed my one dear disciple, leaving me no choice but to take revenge
Tokgo defeated a pair of eyes and looked quietly at the sword dust that appeared to be barely twenty-somethings old but hundred meters away	 No matter what, I will act in place of my disciple for the sake of justice today
His eyes were extremely sharp, as if he had sharp swords, and his eyes flashed over and over	” Dugu Qiubai’s spoke darkly
"Dust in the dust, at such a young age, she will have a strength that is not weaker than that of the old man, and your accomplishment in the kendo will reach a height that even the old man could not match	 His previously calm voice had already started to fill up with a bloodlust that would cause people to tremble and shake
Unfortunately, you killed my only lover, this hatred	', 'But Jian Chen’s face remained calm as ever as he stared back at Dugu Qiubai impassively
I have to report that I must be fair for my only child in any case today	 His white robes fluttered gently into the air while the hair that dangled at his waist was sent dancing in the wind freely
" Tokgo said with a loss, and in a seemingly calm tone, it was filled with a chilling and quivering kill	', '“I cannot be blamed for that
Jian Chen looked very calm, his eyes lightly watching the unfair defeat of Tokgo, his body dressed in a white robe fluttering in the wind, and that a waist long hair, but also by the wind blowing in random fluttering, it looks really cool	 It was your disciple that decided to offend me first
"It's no wonder that I, your apprentice took the initiative to offend me	 It could only be blamed on his lack of skill that he was killed by my own sword
As for my death under my sword, I can only blame him for not doing his fine art	” Jian Chen’s lips opened and closed gently as the words came flowing out from his mouth
" Jian Chen's lips gently opened and closed, a faint voice spit out of his mouth	', 'Laughing angrily, Dugu Qiubai spoke, “A lack of skill? Very well then! Then today I will see just how experienced you are
Tokgo fought and angered and smiled: “Okay, good, good, good, bad arts, then I’m going to meet you today to see how much energy you have, and whether you can put the old man in your hands	 Let this old man see where you will be able to execute me with your Light Wind Sword
Sword under the wind	”', 'As he spoke, Dugu Qiubai waved his Heavy Iron Sword
"Saying, when Tokgo defeated Xuan Tie in his hand, suddenly, a mighty sword rushed out of the sword, and with a fierce sword, he shot at a speed as fast as lightning speed toward the sword dust 100 meters away	 Immediately, a strong amount of Sword Qi began to escape the sword before shooting straight for Jian Chen a hundred meters away with the speed of a lightning bolt
Jian Chen's look of calm, with a sound of the sword's scabbard, that long sword carried in the back in an instant appears in the hands of sword dust, which is full of four feet long, two fingers wide and slender sword sword The body is exudes a layer of silver Jianmang, then the sword in the hands of the sword dust quickly stabbed out, I saw a strong sword and sword out of the sword, with the naked eye can not capture the speed toward the unlucky shot to shoot the sword Air strikes	', 'Unsheathing his sword with an impassive face, Jian Chen quickly drew out the long sword that had been on his back to his hand
"Boom!"The two swords collided in a gas phase and burst into a loud crash, deafening	 This double-edged sword was about 1
The powerful infuriating waves centred on the explosion point, quickly spread out in all directions, and dispersed the faint clouds around them	3 meters long and two fingers wide with a white light
Then, sword dust and Tokgo fought and lost at the same time and flew away from the mountain where the foot stood, flew between the two peaks, and engaged in fierce fighting in mid-air	 Stabbing forward with the sword, an even more fierce amount of Sword Qi appeared from the sword and shot towards the jet of Sword Qi from Dugu Qiubai with a speed almost impossible to see with the naked eye
The speed of the two men's shots was extremely fast, and the sound of the weapons and the sound of friction rang in the air	', '“Bang!”', 'The two rays of Sword Qi collided with a loud explosion that rocked the eardrums
The strong Jian Qi shot from the two warring positions to the surrounding chaos, and shot a big hole on the surrounding peaks	 A large wave of Qi scattered away from the epicenter with great speeds, scattering the lingering wisp of mist and clouds nearby
Countless gravels fell to the ground below the feet	', 'Straight away, Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai flew straight for each other, leaving the twin peaks they had initially been standing on
Just a few breathing time, sword dust and Tokgo defeated the two quickly battled hundreds of rounds, and then when the two fell back on the two peaks, I saw only two were slightly emaciated	 As they reached the midway point of the two peaks, they began to engage each in a fierce battle midair
, On the original unblemished clothes, there have been a lot of cracks and become a bit rags up	', 'The two men had strikes that were impeccably fast and the sounds made from their weapons striking against each other had been an endless stream of metallic rings
Tokgo defeated his face and looked at the sword dust seriously	 A sharp amount of Sword Qi shot out from all directions from the two and left giant holes in the landscape around them
His look became dignified, and he replied, "Surely a good sword, no wonder you can't break it in the rivers and lakes, but you can't be old	 As a result, countless of rocks had been sent cascading down a thousand meters below
" Tokgo lost his tone and continued and said: “We can hardly tell the difference by winning the game	', 'Within several breaths worth of time, Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai had already exchanged several hundred blows at lightning quick speeds
It is better to apply the strongest blow at the same time and decide the outcome with one stroke	 Afterwards, the two men had leapt back to their respective mountain peaks
” Then, the momentum of Tokyu’s defeat was sudden	 Each person were in a worse-for-wear state and had more than enough tears in their previously perfect clothing
A skyrocketing sky is like a skyscraper	', 'With a serious expression that seemed to grow even more grim each second, Dugu Qiubai growled, “What a fast sword, it is no wonder that no one in the Jianghu is able to break past your sword
Jian Chen's face became dignified, and then, the body exudes a huge incomparable momentum, no less than Tokgo seeking defeat	 But, it is powerless against this old man
The imposing momentum of the two men and women climbed up and overwhelmed the entire sky, and the two menacing forces combined to directly envelope the entire mountain, tens of thousands of miles away	” Dugu Qiubai paused for a moment before continuing to say, “If we continue on like this, the victor of this match will be hard to determine
Even the clouds in the sky were rushed by the momentum of the two men	 We may as well use our strongest strike to find out the victor
A big hole emerged and quickly dispersed	” With that, Dugu Qiubai suddenly exploded with power that seemed as if it was a single giant sword that pierced into the skies
The squalls in the sky whistled and shrieked and screamed	', 'Growing serious as well, Jian Chen too began to spike with a large amount of power that was by no means weaker than Dugu Qiubai
In the mountains and forests, countless birds and beasts issued horror calls, and they fled with their limbs to the distance	', 'The power of the two men continued to escalate with an earth-shattering amount of force that filled the entire area
The two peaks of the top of the mountain are constantly increasing, and they are all brewing the strongest blow	 Soon enough, the power of the two began to cover the both of them and all over the entire mountains
"Oh!" "Oh!"Not far from the mountains and forests, many small trees can not afford the strong momentum of the two people, have been blocking the waist break, and then by the two giants of the momentum to the red sky, flying far	 Even the clouds themselves had a hole in them from the power exuded by the two
As the momentum of both sword dust and lone defeating people continues to rise, a strong true air flow appears around the body of both of them, and the two people quickly rotate around and the trees and trees are both The formidable momentum of the pressure to bend the waist, numerous trees have shaken body, swinging	 A fierce gale began to scream and whistle with an ear-piercing sound that was reminiscent of a ghost wailing into the winds
At the same time, the light wind sword in the hands of sword dust and the mysterious iron epee defeated by Tokgo exudes a dazzling white light and dark black light	 Down in the forests below, countless of animals began to let out terrified sounds as they began to scuttle away from the area as far as their limbs could take them
The true air flow around them was becoming more and more powerful	 The strength of the two men on the peaks continued to escalate as they prepared to unleash their strongest strike
Finally, the whole body of the sword dust was covered with a thick layer of white light	', '“Kacha!” “Kacha!”', 'Not too far away in the mountains, several small trees were unable to withstand the power of the two
And the defeat of Tokyu was also wrapped in a layer of black light, and the figure of the two had been completely lost	 Snapping and breaking into several pieces, they were sent flying into the air and far away from the place
In the air, we saw two groups of diametrically opposite dazzling lights	', 'While Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai’s strength continued to rise, a stream of Qi began to stream around them in a single revolution
"Oh!"The long sword in the sword dust was trembling lightly	 Any trees or pieces of grass in the area had been pressed down against the ground in the face of their might, and several of the larger trees had even began to shake back and forth
At the moment, the sword was already shining with bright swords	', 'At the same time, a dazzling glow of white light appeared in Jian Chen’s Light Wind Sword while a jet-black light appeared in Dugu Qiubai’s Heavy Iron Sword
This powerful sword feels scared	', 'The Qi circulating around the two men began to grow stronger and stronger until there was a rich white glow that surrounded Jian Chen completely, and a deep black glow that surrounded Dugu Qiubai inside
His long black hair fluttered wildly in the wind, and his white robe floated in the wind	 The both of them had disappeared into their respective colors while all that was left to see was two balls of light shining with the exact opposite colors of each other
His whole body was vacant, and it looked as if the Buddha was a god of war and could not be defeated	', '“Yin!”', 'Jian Chen’s Light Wind Sword had already been filled with a resplendent glow and had started to shake with a powerful Sword Qi that would cause anyone to feel frightened
When the momentum of the two climbed to the top, suddenly, the two made a terrible anger and sounded at the same time	 His black hair had fluttered crazily in the winds while the white robe he wore fluttered with it
It sounded as if the thunderbolt suddenly rang and was deafening	 His entire body floated in midair, and a single look was all it took for him to be identified as a war god with an indomitable strength
Then, he saw a brilliant white light and darkness in the dark	', 'As the two men’s strength continued to climb up to the peak, the two men suddenly let out a furious roar that shook the heavens like a bolt of lightning and pierced the ear drums
Lightning speed collided and flashed	 Straight away, a beautiful bright white light and a dark black light shot towards each other with incredible speed
There was no imaginary collision sound	 In the instant where the two would collide against each other…', 'There had been no sound as one would expect
When everything calmed down, I saw the sword dust and Tokgo defeated the two have changed a position, re-distance from the distance of 100 meters standing on the top of the two peaks, the two faces look It was extremely pale, and on the dust of the sword dust, the red blood quickly flowed out	 When everything had calmed down, one could see that Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai had changed spots
He immediately dyed his white robe quickly	 Each one were now on the other mountain peak away from each other with an equally pal face
Just in the lightning staggered and outdated, Tokgo defeated the sword and pierced it	 A steady stream of blood could be seen flowing from Jian Chen’s chest, staining his pure white robes instantly
His heart	 In that split-instance where the two sides had crossed paths, Dugu Qiubai’s sword had pierced through Jian Chen’s heart
The defeat of Tokgo had already lost his entire right arm	', 'As for Dugu Qiubai, he had lost his entire right arm, meaning that he would not be able to wield a sword any longer
He who had lost his right arm was no longer able to take the sword	 The Heavy Iron Sword that had been in it had long since dropped down a thousand meters into the cliffs below
The black iron epee held in his right hand had fallen off the cliff at the foot of the mountain	 At the time where he had pierced Jian Chen’s heart, he had lost his right arm in exchange
After a sword pierced the heart of the sword dust, it lost the same arm	', 'Standing silently on top of the mountain peak, a stream of fresh blood began to slowly leak from his mouth
The sword dust quietly stood above the mountain peak, his mouth slowly drained a trace of blood, and his face became paler and lighter	 His white face continued to grow paler and paler before it became as pale as paper
In a short time, he was already pale like paper	 His heart had been pierced by Dugu Qiubai’s sword, meaning that he was doomed to be stuck in an impasse where death was inevitable
His The heart was punctured by a sword that was unsuccessful and was already in a desperate situation	', '“Hahaha…” Suddenly, Dugu Qiubai began to laugh from the mountain peak he was standing on
” Suddenly, the unlucky person on the opposite side of the mountain peak suddenly lost his laughter and laughed: “The sword dust, with your talent, if it’s for you for a few years, the old man is definitely not yours	 “Jian Chen, with your talent, you would most likely be able to defeat me given several years
The opponent, unfortunately, ah, unfortunately, although your strength is not much worse than the old man, but in the end it is still lost in the hands of the old man	 But how unfortunate it is for you that your strength is lacking from mine
" Said here, Tokgo seek defeat and sighed, said: "Hey	 In the end, you were still defeated by my hand
generation of Tianjiao on such a burial In the hands of the old man, I really regretted it, but in order to report the murder of the murderer, the old man had to be so	” As he spoke, Dugu Qiubai sighed shortly
"Feeling the vitality that was passing by him, the sword dust slowly closed his eyes	 “Ai…for an old man like me to see to the funeral of a genius, what a sorrowful matter
At this moment, he seemed very calm	 But however, I must do what I must to avenge my disciple
For him, life and death may not be of great value	”', 'Sensing that he was slowly being cut away from the power of life, Jian Chen began to close his eyes
After all these years, the swords and dusts have swept the rivers and lakes	 At that moment, he was at peace with himself
After killing many people, they have already looked down on life and death	 Death to him was no important manner
The only regret in mind is that since then there has been no chance to explore the culmination of kendo	 After all, after traveling so many years in the Jianghu, Jian Chen had killed many men and death had long since dulled his emotions
As soon as the sword dust fell into a state of no grief and joy, suddenly, a strange feeling appeared in the mind of Jian Chen	 The only emotion he had felt in his heart was that he would have no more chances to explore the pinnacle of the way of the sword
At this crucial moment, the soul of sword dust seemed to blend in with the long sword in his hands	', 'Just as Jian Chen submitted himself to a realm of calm, a sudden but strange feeling appeared within Jian Chen’s mind
Swords, Swords Even if he, he and the sword, no longer divide each other, as if the sword in his hands has become a part of his soul	 In that crucial moment, Jian Chen’s spirit seemed to have harmonized with his long sword
At the same time, the pure and powerful atmosphere of heaven and earth descends from heaven and earth, and flows into his mind along the mind of the sword and dust, perfectly integrating with his soul	 He was the sword, and the sword was him; there had been no difference between the two of them
With the injection of gas, the sword dust clearly felt that his “god” was growing at an incredible speed, and at the same time, his soul seemed to be separated from the body and flew to the endless mountains around him, at this moment, The sights within ten miles radius are clearly present in Jian Chen's mind	 It was almost as if the sword had already became a part of his soul
Even the mosquitoes on the ground can clearly feel their activities	', 'At the same time, a powerful and pure amount of world energy began to descend from the skies before flowing into his mind one stream after another
In this very near death, he actually broke through	 As it entered, it began to perfectly harmonize with his soul, and as the energy of the world continued to pour into him, Jian Chen could distinctly feel that his own “spirit” began to grow at an accelerated rate
	 Simultaneously, his soul began to leave his body and into the boundless mountains and fields ahead
	 At this very moment, everything within five thousand meters could be distinctly seen in Jian Chen’s mind
	 He could even see a single mosquito on the ground living as it pleased without a problem
	', 'At the verge of his death, he had somehow managed to breakthrough…

Chapter 2 Changyang Xiangtian Suddenly, the long sword in the hands of sword dust escaped the control of sword dust	['', '[] [] []', '', 'Chapter 2: Changyang Xiang Tian', 'Suddenly, the sword in Jian Chen’s hand started to control itself; it was as if the longsword had a mind of its own
At this moment, this long sword seems to have become a spiritual sword, and it turns into a light with a lightning speed of 100 meters away	 Unexpectedly, the sword shot toward Dugu Qiubai like a bolt of lighting, traveling at a very high speed
Tokgo seeks defeat and shoots	', 'The speed of the longsword was almost inconceivable
The long sword is very fast and incredibly fast	 Dugu Qiubai only reacted when the sword had reached his throat
When Tokgo's defeat just reacts, the sword has arrived at the throat of Tokgo's defeat, and then with a strong sword, in the thrilling eyes of Tokgo defeated him	 The sword was infused with an extraordinarily fierce sword qi
After passing directly through his throat, the sword circling a large circle in the air surrounded by a layer of white, white swords automatically flew back into the hands of sword dust	 Dugu Qiubai widened his eyes in fear just as the longsword pierced through his neck
There was a fist-sized hole in the throat of Tokgo's defeated opponent	 After finishing the strike, mist appeared from the hilt of the sword
Although the sword in the sword dust was very thin, the Kenmang around the sword still allowed Tokgo to cut the wound at the throat to the size of the fist	 The mist swirled around in midair momentarily before the sword returned to Jian Chen’s hand
Tokgo’s eyes widened and he stared blindly at the long sword that had returned to the hands of the sword and dust, and his face could not believe it, as if he had seen the most incredible thing in the world, he slightly opened his mouth, and it seemed that What I want to say is that, unfortunately, his throat has been pierced and he has been unable to speak	', 'A fist-sized hole slowly appeared in the middle of Dugu Qiubai’s throat
Finally, with a reluctant look and a horror at his face, he slowly falls down	 The sword tip had expanded as it pierced through Dugu Qiubai’s neck, enlarging the wound
Jian Chen, holding a long sword, silently looked at his untimely defeat, and sighed in his heart	 If not for that, it would have been impossible for a sword that thin to create a wound of that size
Unexpectedly, at this last moment, he actually broke through again and reached the realm of the Sword of God	', 'Dugu Qiubai’s eyes were wide open as he stared at the sword, not believing what he saw
But at this time, he is not far from death	 After all, he had just witnessed an impossible feat
Secret sigh, sword dust looks gradually become dark, even though the strength once again break through, but it is difficult to escape death, after all, his heart has been crushed by the undefeated sword	 He slowly opened his mouth to say something, but unfortunately, his throat had already been impaled, rendering him speechless
Afterwards, Jian Chen also stepped into the footsteps of Tokgo’s defeat and slowly fell down	 With a final look of disbelief and terror, he slowly crumpled to the floor, never to stand again
At the moment when the sword dust had just fallen, the two sword-shaped peaks where he stood alone with Tokgo’s defeat had suddenly made a loud noise and the entire mountain burst and opened, and countless gravels were moving toward it	', 'Jian Chen clasped his sword silently before looking at the collapsed Dugu Qiubai; a gasp was threatening to escape from his own mouth
All around the lasing away, then the sky filled with purple and blue light, shining in the world, at this moment, the entire sky was filled with purple and blue light, unfortunately, sword dust and Tokgo seek defeat has been unable to know What happened then	 He didn’t think that in this final hour of life he would make a breakthrough into the realm of the Sword God
In a large and luxurious manor house, in a decorated and magnificent house, a large group of people gathered at the door of a room at the moment, while the first person was a young man who walked in front of the door	 But however it was for naught, as he himself was close to death as well
With an anxious and somewhat worried look, the young man is about thirty years old and looks good	', 'Inwardly sighing, Jian Chen’s eyes slowly began to dim
Even though he is close to middle age, he can't hide his face's handsome time and he only wears it	 Even though the breakthrough empowered his body, it was very hard to escape death, especially when one’s innards are skewered
Wearing a white robe embroidered with gold silk, the body has a breath of the upper person, a face of fortitude, a pair of brows has been tightly crumpled into a group	', 'Soon after, Jian Chen followed Dugu Qiubai’s footsteps into the afterlife, his body falling to the ground, proceeding into the abyss
Three meters away from the door, a group of about 30 people stood there with worries	', 'After Jian Chen had fallen, the area in which he and Dugu Qiubai had fallen started to shake
Some of them were old and young, and they seemed to have been six or seven years old	 So much so, that the two sword-like mountain peaks emitted a loud sound that shook the heavens and split the two mountains in half
With his white hair and wrinkles on his face, the eyes of those eyes flash with scary eyes	 Countless boulders and stones tumbled down the mountainside, creating an avalanche in all directions
From the eyes of their eyes, they may even think that they are not like one at all	 The sky turned purple and green and the heavens and earth were illuminated
The aged old man is a middle-aged man with a strong figure and a fierce dragon	 The colors danced and mixed to form a beautiful picture, and it was a shame that neither Jian Chen nor Dugu Qiubai were alive to see it, or the series of events which would follow afterwards…', '……', 'Inside a spacious and luxurious mansion, was a room decorated with great splendor
Most of the rest are middle-aged men aged 30 to 40	 Outside this room, a large group of people had gathered
All of them are imposing and impeccable in appearance	 A young male paced relentlessly in front of the doors, his face was filled with anxiety and worry
At first glance, they know that they are extraordinary people	 He looked to be thirty years of age, and he gave off a majestic aura
And in the room opposite them, there was a woman crying with pain	 Although he had aged a little, one could still see the handsome youth that he once was
forcefully, hard, and she's going to come out right away, and she'll come out right away	 He was wearing a gold lined silver chang pao, which added to his handsome appearance, and he was surrounded by an aura similar to that of a host
" A little eager voice followed, sounding a little old, and I knew at a glance that the voice's owner was not young	 His face was resolute, even his eyebrows were knitted together, almost forming a single lump
But also women	', 'Three meters outside of the room, a group of 30 people, ranging from young to old, were all lined up nervously
Outside the room, the middle-aged man, who walked in anxiously in front of the door, suddenly stopped and eagerly said, "Hey	 The elders of the group looked to be 60 to 70 years old already, with white hair all over their wrinkled faces
it's been all day and night	 However, despite their age, their eyes could still make people shiver and quake in fear from the godly lights that flickered within
How has Yuner not been born yet? If In such a drag, I am afraid that Yuner will also be adversely affected	 Judging by the glow from their eyes, the amount of fear they could inflict on others was so much that people wouldn’t take them to be frail old men at all, but rather robust and healthy middle aged men with the strengths of a tiger and dragon combined
" The young man's voice is filled with worries and he is worried	 The rest of the men were all around 30 to 40 years old, with imposing auras\xa0and eyes that revealed nothing
"Homeowner, don't worry, Mrs	 It was obvious with only one glance that this was not a group of normal people
Cloud will be all right	', 'And within the room in front of them, the sounds of a woman crying in pain could be heard
You must not forget that Madame Cloud is a bright teacher	', '“Madam, keep on pushing, the baby is almost out
" A woman with white hair and wrinkled face on his face persuades him, though his tone is full of words	 I repeat, the baby is almost out…” An elderly but impatient voice could be heard through the pain-filled echoes
Self-confidence, but still hides the look of worry	 Those who could hear the voice could tell the owner of the voice was an elderly woman
" Wearing a white robe, the young man with a superior temperament once again sighed heavily	', 'Outside the room, the middle aged man who was anxiously pacing about, abruptly froze in place and spoke\xa0with a sense of urgency, “Ai…this has been going on for an\xa0entire day and night already, how has Yun’er not given birth? If this drags on for any longer, I’m afraid even Yun’er will face an unfavorable situation
The look of anxiety on his face was still not reduced	” Even the man’s voice was filled with never ending anxiety
Then a group of people waited outside the room for more than two hours	', '“My lord, please don’t worry too much
Finally, an excited voice came out of the room: "The owner, the owner, Mrs	 Madam Yun’er will definitely be fine
Cloud was born, and Mrs	 You forget that Madam Yun’er is a bright Saint Master
Cloud was born, and the mother and son were safe	” A white haired elder spoke with a tone of confidence, but even his face could not hide the look of worry on it
He was a boy	', '“Ai…” The lord clad in a white chang pao began to sigh again repeatedly; the worry and anxiety on his face did not decrease even the slightest amount
"The voice is full of excitement	', 'Eventually, after the men outside had waited for two more hours, an excited voice came from within the room
The voice of the young man who was anxiously waiting outside the door of the room was finally swept away	 “My lord, my lord! Madam Yun’er has given birth! She has given birth and is safe! And so is the boy!” The amount of emotion in the voice was stirring up excitement throughout the house
It was filled with excitement and excitement in his face	', 'Upon hearing that, the middle age man that was waiting anxiously became slack-jawed; the wariness in his face had been completely wiped out and replaced with an expression of joy and emotions
Then nothing was said, and he pushed the door open and disappeared	 He was so emotionally moved that he couldn’t find the right words to say, and blew open the doors so quickly that it was as if they didn’t exist in the first place
No, it's incredible that speed is incredible	 His speed was almost inconceivable; no ordinary man could possess enough strength to pull off the same amount of speed he had just displayed
It's definitely not an ordinary person's ability	', 'The middle aged man immediately flashed over to the bedside and sat down beside it
The young man immediately came to a large bed in the room, sat on the edge of the bed, looked at the woman lying on the bed with concern, and said, "Yeah, how are you? You're okay!" The voice was soft and full	 His face was full of concern as he looked at the woman who was reclining on top of it
Lying on the bed is a young woman about 20 years old	 “Yun’er, how are you feeling; you have to be all right!” Despite his excitement, his voice was gentle and was brimming with concern
Her appearance is beautiful, her dignified country is full of glory	', 'On top of the bed was a woman who was in the peak of her 20’s
It is a beautiful face that is already fragrant and sweaty, her face is slightly white, and her face is exhausted	 Her appearance was so beautiful, it could cause an entire state to fight and collapse upon itself for her hand
Looking at the young man with tired eyes, the woman smiled on her face and said, "My husband-in-law, I'm fine, let me see our children	 Her exhausted and pale face was drenched in sweat, but still managed to retain a divine look
""Good! Good! Good! Yuner is fine	', 'The female looked up with a tired expression at the man by her side and smiled, “My dear husband, I am fine
" The young man's face showed a happy smile	 Please just allow me to see my baby
Then he turned to look at the midwife next to the child	”', '“Oh! Yes! Right away! As long as Yun’er is fine
When he was about to speak, he saw the midwife's brow tight	” The man started to smile with joy, but he turned around and looked at the bundled up child in the midwife’s arms
Tightly wrinkled, staring strangely at the baby he was holding in his arms, his hands kept playing, his mouth kept yelling, "Cry, cry, your child	 Right as he was about to speak, the eyebrows on the midwife knitted together and stared with rapt attention at the infant she was holding
Why don't we cry, strangely enough, I have been delivering for such a long time	 Her arms continued to rock the bundle as she muttered, “Cry baby, go on and cry
There are not thousands of children born in my hand, but there are also hundreds of them	 What child are you that you do not cry? How odd, I have delivered many babies, and although the numbers have not reached over a thousand babies, I have helped given birth to over 900
For the first time, I have seen a child who was not crying at first	 However, this is the first time I have seen a freshly delivered baby that does not cry
”At this time, a group of people outside entered the room one by one, one by one with a smile on their faces, and they all greeted the woman lying in bed	”', 'But at the same time she spoke, the men who were outside all piled into the room, each one of them had a smile on their faces
The middle-aged man had a happy smile on his face and said softly to the woman lying on the bed: "Yun Yun, you lay down for a while and I went to carry the child over	 One after another each person began to congratulate the woman on the bed
" Then, the young man got up and came The name of the midwife, said: "What happened, is this child does not have any problems	', 'The middle aged man was still smiling greatly and spoke to the woman, “Yun’er, you should rest up first
" Young men's tone is slightly heavy, some children will be born with natural emergencies, this is a very common thing, and the occurrence of The number of times is still quite a few	 I’ll bring the child over in a second
He is really afraid of what's wrong with his own children	” The man then got up and walked towards the midwife, “What’s wrong? Could it be there’s some sort of problem with the child?” His voice had dropped down slightly; sometimes, some children would be born with diseases
Wen Sheng, the face of the midwife, looked at the young man and said respectfully: "I don't know if there is any problem with the owner and the young master, but according to my decades of experience in giving birth	 This occurrence wasn’t uncommon, and would actually happen often
Every child will cry when he is born, but the situation of your young master is a little different	 He was already afraid that his newly born child had some sort of problem
You see, he didn't even cry when he was born	', 'Hearing his question, the midwife’s face went sour as she looked at him, and said respectfully, “My lord, the young lord has no problems that I am aware of, but according to my 10 years of experience, every newborn child will start to cry
This is very strange	 But this young lord is different; look here, ever since his birth, he hasn’t uttered even a single peep of sound
”Hearing that, the young man frowned and looked at the baby that was being held by the midwife, and saw that the baby’s bright eyes without any impurities were turning around and looking at it	 This is an extremely strange situation
I would stare there for a while, very cute, and it looks like there is no problem	”', 'The man’s forehead creased in thought as he looked at the bundled infant
However, he did not see it, deep in the eyes of the baby that is bright without impurities, but with a deep shock and can not believe it	 The infant’s eyes were bright and showed no impurities within them as it looked all over the place
Afterwards, the young man put one hand on the baby's body and saw a sudden, sultry, yellowish glow on the palm of his hand	 One moment he would look over here, and the next moment he would look over there
Seeing the action of the young man, the face of the midwife also became a little uneasy	 He was very cute in this way, and just by looking at him you would think there were no problems with him
She was only a small midwife and was a person living at the bottom	', 'However, the man didn’t notice that the infant’s bright eyes didn’t have a single impurity in the vast abyss of his pupils
She was really afraid of the baby in her arms	 In fact, it had seemed like his eyes held a profoundness that shook the man’s inner self, though he himself didn’t believe it
Otherwise, the young man was blamed for the crime, but the consequences were not what she could afford	', 'Then as he put his hand on top of the infant, he saw a fine layer of yellow light suddenly float around his palm
Although this matter had nothing to do with her, she did not have the ability to excuse everything	', 'Seeing the middle aged man’s movement, the midwife’s face became uneasy
The young man quickly withdrew his hand, and the heart that had been lifted in his heart was finally put down	 She was only a small midwife, one of society’s lowest class, but even she was afraid if there was a problem with the child
A happy smile appeared on his face	 If there was one, then the man would blame her, and she would not be able to recover from it
"The child is all well and there is no problem at all	 Despite the fact that this situation was not related to her in anyway, she wouldn’t have the power to say otherwise
" The young man said	', 'The man quickly took his hand back, his own heart was finally at ease
He took the baby from the midwife	 A smile returned to his face once more as he laughed, “The child is safe and sound, I can’t find even a single problem
After listening to this, the midwife suddenly breathed a sigh of relief	” He took the bundle from the midwife with another laugh
The heart that had been lifted was finally put down, and a happy smile appeared on his face	', 'Upon hearing this, the midwife let out a breath of air in relief
“The adult’s owner is saying, maybe it’s representative of the young master’s	 With her heart rate slowly going back to normal, even she started to laugh in excitement, “What the lord says is correct, perhaps this is a representation of the young lord’s future
Unusually, young masters will surely become a masterpiece in the future	 He will surely become a strong and unique individual as he grows
"After listening to the midwife's sentence, the young man, despite knowing that everything was very embarrassing, couldn't help but laugh, and said, "All right, all right, all right	”', 'As he listened to the midwife, knowing that this was an extraordinarily vague thing to say, he still couldn’t help but laugh, “Yes yes yes, I can only hope so
I hope so, come, come and fight	 Someone come here! Let us reward Mother Hong with a hundred gold coins!”', 'The midwife’s face grew joyously and immediately said with emotion, “I give the lord many thanks, many many thanks indeed!”', 'The father brought the infant to his mother on the bed and smiled, “Yun’er, look! This is our child, look how cute he is!”', 'Yun’er held onto the child tenderly and gave him a kiss on the forehead and spoke happily, “Dear husband, since our child is a boy, then as per our agreement beforehand, we shall call him Changyang Xiang Tian
Reward mother’s 100 gold coins	”', 'Laughing, the husband said, “Not bad, I hereby officially declare that this child’s name will be Changyang Xiang Tian! Come all! I invite all of my guests here today, tomorrow there will be a feast in my son’s honor! We shall celebrate greatly…
”Hearing that, the midwife looked overjoyed, and suddenly the tone of excitement was: "Thank you for your reward, thank you for your reward!"The young people took the baby to the woman lying on the bed and said with a happy face: "Yun Yun, you see, this is our child	”', 'In a flash, a year had already passed
How lovely is it	 In front of a small lake, the figure of a child that wasn’t even one meter tall stood about with a blank expression
"The woman, known as Yuner, reached out and embraced the baby	 Both of his eyes were staring attentively at the rock garden in the middle of the lake
He kissed the baby's face with a kiss, and said: "Oh, husband, since the boy is a boy, according to our previous agreement, the child was named Changyang	 The little boy was wearing a gorgeous set of clothes, but the expression on his face was unusually complex in a way that was strange to see on a one year old boy
Xiang Tian it	', 'To be precise, this boy was\xa0Changyang Xiang Tian
"The young people laughed and said, "Yes, now I formally give my child a name and Changyang Xiangtian, come, invite all the guests in the city of Lore	 And in this moment inside of his mind, a hair raising scene was constantly playing
I will have a banquet in Changyang Prefecture tomorrow, and I'll celebrate it	 Just as if watching a movie reel, all he could see were pictures of mountain ranges that looked like two giant swords
"In an instant, the time has passed	 Another image of a handsome young man of 20 years old with a sword came to his mind, along with the hundred year old battle hardened figure of Dugu Qiubai
In front of a small lake in a large courtyard, a young boy less than a meter tall is standing there blankly, eyes staring intently at the center of the small lake	 Finally at the time of his immediate death, he remembered the breakthrough he had experienced that had allowed him to reach into the realm of the ”Sword God”
Rockery, the little boy wearing a gorgeous dress, the look on his face is very complex, so this look appears on a young boy who is younger than three years old and looks quite different	 After that, he remembered stabbing Dugu Qiubai through the neck, ending in their mutual destruction…', '', '[] [] []', '', '']
The young boy is Changyang Xiangtian	
At this moment, in the mind of Changyang Xiangtian, there is a continuous scene of thrilling movements, as if slowly moving past the movie, it is in an endless range of mountains	
In the two sword-type mountain peaks, a very handsome young man, who was only 20 years old, was armed with a long sword, and fought with the undefeated master who defeated the rivers and lakes a hundred years ago	
At the time of death, the strength once again broke through and reached the realm of "God's Imperial Sword	
" Toutut defeated the sword and put it through the throat, so that both of them eventually died	
Chapter 3 Sculpting Changyang Xiangtian looked at his own short body and sighed in his heart	['', '[] [] []', 'Chapter 3: Refining the Body', '', 'Xiang Tian looked at his tiny body and gasped; the look on his face could only be described as complex
His complexion was full of complexities	 Over the past year, he had lost count of how often moments of his past life had flashed before his eyes
In this year's time, these images in his head had not been known to have appeared many times	 The memories were so fresh in his mind, it was almost as if everything happened only yesterday; as if engraved into the very depths of his soul
These things seemed to have happened yesterday	 No matter what he did, he couldn’t forget the memories, but he understood now; he was called Jian Chen in his past life
The memory was so clear	 After his death, he had carried with him the mysteries of his memory and soul, and had been reincarnated
It seemed as if it had been deeply imprinted in the depths of his soul	', 'He retained all of his memories even after his reincarnation, so even after being born, he already knew how to talk
He could not forget it	 And according to the conversations from the people at his bedside, he had a rough idea of what type of household he was in
Now, he has long understood that his past life is sword dust and he died	 More importantly, he had learned that he was no longer in the same world as before
The inexplicable reincarnation came with souls and memories	 This was a new world that Jian Chen had never heard of
As the sword dust was born, it retains the memory of past lives	', 'Even the mansion Jian Chen lived in had a name–Changyang Mansion
So soon after birth, it had learned the language	 The mansion belonged to one of Luo’er City’s top 4 families, each had a foothold of power and influence
Later, based on the conversations in the other population, we have already learned roughly what the family was born	 His own father was actually the leader of the Changyang clan named Changyang Ba
The existence of such kind, at the same time, has also roughly understood that the world is not the world in which it originally existed, but another new world	 His mother was named Bi Yuntian and was the fourth concubine for the clan leader
It is a world where the sword dust has never heard of	 Although she wasn’t the primary wife, she still had a considerable amount of power in the family because she held the title of a Radiant Saint Master
The huge house name where the sword dust lives is Changyang House and Changyang House	', 'Even though Jian Chen didn’t understand what a Radiant Saint Master was, he did understand that it was because his mother was a Radiant Saint Master that her status was high in the clan, and there were many that respected her
It is one of the four major families in the city of Lorra	', 'In regards to Jian Chen himself, he was the Changyang clan’s fourth young lord, and had a majestic status within the clan
It has a pivotal position in the entire city of Lorra and its father is Changyang	 Jian Chen also had 2 elder brothers and an elder sister
The owner of the house is named Changyang Pa, and his mother, named Pik Wan Tin, is the fourth commander of the Changyang government’s homeowner Yang Pa, not the main house	 The first brother was Changyang Hu, the sister was Changyang Mingyue, and the second brother was Changyang Ke
However, his mother’s position in Changyang’s government is not low	 The four of them shared the same father, but each had a different mother
Because she is a bright teacher	 Excluding Changyang Hu, Changyang Mingyue\xa0and Changyang Ke had met with him multiple times and were both only a few years older than him
Although Jian Chen did not know exactly what Bright Master is, he also understood that his mother's status as a bright teacher was very high throughout Changyang Prefecture and was respected by many people	 The eldest of the siblings was Changyang Ming\xa0Yue, who was 4 years old; 3 years older than Jian Chen
The sword dust itself is the four young masters of the Changyang government and has a very lofty identity	 Changyang Ke was 2 years older than him
Above the sword dust, there are two older brothers and one older sister	 Aside from them 4 however, there were still many other children in the family
They are the older brother Changyang Hu, the second sister Changyang Mingyue, and the third brother Changyangke	', 'At this time, an elderly housekeeper came up from behind Jian Chen and spoke softly, “4th young lord, it’s getting late, and your mother is looking for you
Both they and Jian Jian are born of the same father	”', 'Jian Chen was immediately jolted back to reality
Among them, in addition to the big brother Changyanghu, the second sister Changyang Mingyue and the third brother Changyang Ke Jianchen have seen several times	 Looking at the sky, he had come to the sudden realization that the sky was dimming, an indication of the impending night
They are all children under the age of the sword dust	 Unconsciously, Jian Chen had been standing there for the whole afternoon
The oldest second sister is just over four years old this year	 “I understand, Chang Bai
The sword dust was three years old, and the third brother Chang Yang Ke was two years older than Jian Chen	 I will go back in a second
This year was just three years old	”', 'Chang Bai was the housekeeper for the Changyang clan and essentially took care of every single matter within the family
In addition to them, Changyang Fuchu still has many children belonging to the Yan family	 Because of this, his status within the clan was fairly high
At this time, an old man dressed as a steward came behind the sword dust and said in a gentle voice: “The four young masters, the time is late, and the lady told you to go back	 Although he was only a housekeeper, he had garnered a good amount of respect, practically the same amount as the head of the house himself had
”Wen Sheng, Jian Chen just came back to the gods	', 'A smile adorned Chang Bai’s face as he watched Jian Chen with high expectations
When he saw the sky, he suddenly discovered that the sky had been played	 Even when Jian Chen was only half a year old, he hadn’t needed the help of others to walk, and quickly learned how to speak within 8 months
It was a sign that the night was approaching	 Not only could he speak clearly, but he could even communicate with others
Unconsciously, Jian Chen had already stood here for one afternoon	 With these two achievements alone, Jian Chen had already been called a genius, and many were eagerly awaiting to see how he would grow up
Jian Chen nodded slightly and said: "Ok, Chang Bo, I'll be right back	', 'At night, Jian Chen accompanied his mother, Bi Yuntian, to eat dinner in the dining hall
"The man who was called Changbo by Jian Chen was the steward of Changyang Palace	 The dining hall they both sat in was special; only the head of the house, his concubines, and his children could eat there
Almost everything he had in his daily life at Changyang Fufang was taking care of him	', 'When Bi Yuntian and Jian Chen arrived at the dining hall, three beauties were already sitting at the circular dinner table
His identity in Changyang Fuchu was not low, although Chang Bo was only a butler	 Each one of them looked to be in their 20s, and two of them each held a child in their arms
However, in Changyang, the government did not show a respectful look to anyone, and its identity was almost equal to that of Changyang, the head of the Changyang family	 One of the children was a boy, and the other was a girl
There was a smile on Changbo’s face	 The boy was around 3-4 years old, and was healthy but chubby
He looked into Jian Chen’s eyes with a trace of expectation	 He was the third son and young lord of Changyang Ba–Changyang Ke
With dust age less than half a year old, Jian Chen could walk alone on the ground without relying on human support	', 'The moment Changyang Ke saw Jian Chen, hostility and hatred swelled up in his eyes
In eight months, I can speak and speak clearly, and I have been able to communicate with people	 It was clear to see that he was brimming with the intent to start something, and one could tell that he held a bias against Jian Chen
With these two points, Jian Chen has already veiled the genius title in Changyang Fuchu	', 'The four ladies could all sense the hostility radiating from Changyang Ke towards Jian Chan, but none of them spared a second thought about it
It has now become Changyang	 In their minds, this was merely a small matter between children, and definitely not something that would be of great matter
Fuchu expects the highest person	', 'The other child was a 4-5 year old girl with two ponytails
At night, sword dust went to the dining hall with her mother, Pik Wan, for dinner	 Her bright eyes looked at the still hostile Changyang Ke and laughed
The dining hall they used was a special dining hall	 With her two dimples that appeared with each laugh, she looked exceptionally cute
Only the owner of Changyang House and his own children and several dormitory rooms could use it	 Although she was underaged now, it was certain that after she grew older, she would have beauty that could rival the gods
When Jian Chen and Pik Wan Tien came to the dining room, they had sat on the round dining table with three beautiful women	 This child was the second born of Changyang Ba, as well as the sole female child–Changyang Mingyue
They were all in their twenties, and there were two older people besides them	', '“Fourth brother, you’re here! Come and sit!” Upon seeing Jian Chen, the smile on her face had become even more splendid, as she waved him over
A boy and a girl, boys and girls, look like they are three or four years old	', 'Jian Chen nodded towards Changyang Mingyue\xa0as a greeting, and sat down with his mother at the dinner table
They are long, fat and white	', 'Bi Yuntian began to pamper Jian Chen, softly saying, “Xiang’er, say hello to your aunts and siblings
At the moment, Zheng An is quietly sitting on the bench	”', 'Without any other choice, Jian Chen looked at the pampered ladies, “Hello eldest aunt, second aunt, third aunt, second sister, and third brother
He is the third owner of the Changyang government	” Ever since his mother had discovered that he could speak efficiently, she had been ecstatically teaching him the basic rules of etiquette
At the same time, Changyangke, the three young masters of Changyangfu	 With Jian Chen’s “go with the flow” mindset, he didn’t object to her teachings
As soon as he saw sword dust coming in, Chang Yangke’s small eyes were full of provocative, with a hint of hostility	 It would prove beneficial to him in the long run as well in this new world
Obviously, his heart had a slight prejudice against sword dust	', 'When he had first arrived in this strange new place, he had struggled intensely with this new body
Although the mothers including Jian Chen, the four women all saw the slightest hostility in the eyes of Chang Yanke, but none of the four of them care	 Since he was reincarnated with his old memories, he still felt like Jian Chen
In their opinion, this is only a play for children	 Deep within his soul, he did not think this new life was his, but as time went on, he gradually accepted his new body and life
There is no harm at all	 No matter what though, Bi Yuntian was still his mother
The other little girl looks like she is four or five years old	 Although it was a mystery on how he managed to retain his memories, they had been from a place on another world
She has two small whips on her head	 It had no relationship to this new world, so Jian Chen had decided to hide away the memories in the deepest part of his mind
Her bright eyes are full of weird elfs	 It was time to accept his new life and give it everything he had
There are two small dimples on the shallow smile	', 'The three ladies all smiled at Jian Chen
Very cute, just from the look of her youthful appearance, she can almost certainly wait for her to grow up, and she must be a beautiful woman who will look like a country in all her glory	 One of the ladies wearing golden robes laughed, “Sister Yun Er, it would appear that Xiang Tian is getting more and more intelligent
She is the second child of the owner of Changyang Prefecture, and is also the second wife of Changyang House, Changyang Bright Moon	 Ai… it’s getting harder and harder to only see him as a one year old child
She is the only daughter of the four children of the Changyang government	 I truly am envious of you for having such an intelligent child
“Four younger brothers, you are here, come and sit down!” Seeing the sword dust coming in, the shallow smile on Changyang’s bright moonlight has become even brighter, and he has quickly waved his hand and called out	” The lady who spoke was the second wife of Changyang Ba and mother to Changyang Mingyue–Bai Yushuang,', '“That’s right, younger sister Yun Er, what second sister said is correct
Jian Chen nodded his head slightly against the bright moon of Changyang, and he was also called hello	 Each and every day, I grow even more fond of Xiang Tian
Then he followed his mother to sit in two empty positions on the round table	” Sitting next to Jian Chen with a tranquil look was another one of the 4 ladies
Jian Yun's mother, Pik Wan-tian, looked at her in love with her sword and whispered: "Xiang Er, see you a few aunts and a second sister and a third brother	 She was the third wife–Yu Feng Yan
"Jian Chen helpless, looked at the face of those few delicate women, said: "I saw the big aunt, two aunts, three aunts, second sister, the third brother	', '“Xiang Tian is certainly a child genius
" Since knowing that the sword dust has learned to speak, his mother Bi Yun Tian was happy at the same time, but also hard to pull the sword dust to learn some of the most basic rituals, and the sword dust holding it, then the security of the idea, for their mother's proposal there is no resistance, because he also knows that he It will grow in this new world in the future	 To be able to walk at 6 months and speak at 8, these are feats that no other child his age would be able to replicate
When he first came here, Jian Chen also had a fierce struggle for his own identity	 I find myself anxious to see how much Saint Energy he has when he undergoes the test in 2 years, though I do sincerely hope that he will give us all a pleasant surprise when the time comes
After all, he was a reincarnated former life	” The next lady who spoke was significantly older, and seemed much more temperamental than the others
Since he has retained the memories of his past lives, he is still a sword dust and he is now This identity, in the depths of Jian Chen's heart, is still a little ruled out	 She was the first wife–Ling Long
However, over time, he eventually accepted his current status gradually	', 'The moment Ling Long finished her sentence, a deep manly voice spoke out, “I agree
Anyway, Pik Wan Tian was born with his mother after all	 I look forward to when Xiang Tian reaches his 3rd year for this pleasant surprise as well
Although he had somehow preserved the memories of his previous life after his death, that memory was actually happening in another world	” A 30 year old man entered the dining hall, carrying himself with the manner of a master
There was no connection with it here	 With a white chang pao decorated with golden outlines, and a head of black hair that reached his shoulders, the man gave off a relaxed atmosphere
Today, Jian Chen has already hidden his previous things in his head	', '“Husband!”', '“Father!”', 'Immediately after seeing the man, the 7 people at the table all stood up at once and called out one after the other
At the same time, I intend to accept everything here with a sincere heart	 Jian Chen was no exception, and softly cried out
The three women all looked at Jian Chen with a smile	', 'This young man was indeed the head of the Changyang clan, Changyang Ba
One of the women wearing yellow luxurious clothes said with a smile: "Yun's sister, ah, Xiang Tian is really getting more and more sensible now	', 'Changyang Ba strolled down to the dinner table and sat down with a gentle smile on his face
Hey, it's hard to imagine	 With a look at Jian Chen, he asked, “Xiang’er, are you feeling happy living here still?”', 'Jian Chen nodded his head, “Yes!”', 'A smile curled up on Changyang Ba’s face, “Xiang’er, if you ever feel closed in this stuffy old house, feel free to explore the outside and experience it for yourself!”', '“I know, father!” Jian Chen replied
He is a one-year-old boy	', 'Changyang Ba was indescribably happy at how intelligent Jian Chen was and how much he differed from any other one year old, 
I really admire you	', 'The family dinner went by joyously and the meal was consumed quickly
There is such a clever son	 Afterwards, Jian Chen returned to his room alone
” This woman wearing a yellow dress is the second wife of Chang Yang Fu’s homeowner Chang Yang Ba – Bai Yushuang , the mother of Changyang moon	 Based on his age, he should have been sleeping in the same room as his mother, but he had requested that he wanted his own room
"Yeah Yuner sister, the second sister said it was good	 Regarding this request, Jian Chen had been firm, and wouldn’t be persuaded otherwise
Now I have found that I am more and more like this child of Xiang Tian	 Bi Yuntian had ended up accepting his request
" The woman sitting beside Jian Chen said with a smile, though, but She looked at Jian Chen’s eyes but was calm	', 'And so that night, Jian Chen sat crossed-legged on his bed, with both of his hands on his knees
She was the wife of Changfeng’s three ladies, Yu Fengyan	 The palms of his hands were facing upwards, as was his face, as he silently went through the motions of practicing the first principle of Azulet Sword Law
“Sheng Tian is indeed the most talented child I’ve ever seen	', 'Azulet Sword Law; this was what Jian Chen had been studying for 20 years in his previous world and had become the strongest weapon in his arsenal
He walks alone after half a year and can speak in eight months	 It was a type of cultivation that was both rare and formidable; it had principles that were profound and also contained many strong techniques
This is absolutely impossible for other children of the same age	', 'The Azulet Sword Law was something that Jian Chen had stumbled upon when he was a child
He really looks forward to flying quickly	 He had accidentally fallen off of a cliff while playing in the mountains, and somehow managed to survive the fall by landing in a pool of water
At the age of three, I performed the Holy Power and Potential Tests in the body	 When he had awoken, he had found himself trapped in a cavern with fish as his only source of food
I hope that by the time he will give us all a surprise	 After finding the manual, he had dedicated himself to learning it, and finally succeeded after 10 years
” The woman who spoke was slightly older, and she was full of noble temperament	 With his breakthrough, he was able to jump out of the cavern and return to the lands above
She was the owner of Changyang Prefecture	', 'Jian Chen was a war orphan who had been taken in by his great grandfather and grandmother
The first lady, named Linglong	 10 years had past while he was trapped in the cave, so when he had returned to the village, his great grandparents had already passed away from old age a long time ago
The exquisite voice just fell, and the voice of a man with a simple and honest voice suddenly sounded: "Yeah, I'm also very much looking forward to waiting for Xiang Xiang to perform a Holy Power Test when he is three years old	 After paying his respects to them, the now alone Jian Chen left his little mountainside village to travel the world by himself
It will give us all a surprise	', 'Jian Chen had accepted what life had given him in his past life, and he had accepted this new life as well
" With the voice I saw a young man of nearly 30 years old entering the dining hall	 With this acceptance, he had started cultivating and refining his body for half a year, ready to regain his strength
The young man was exuded with the temperament of a superior	', '[] [] []', '', '']
He was wearing a white robe with golden silk and a long black hair	
He put on his shoulders and gave people a very floating feeling	
"Friday!""Oh!"Upon seeing this young man, the seven people sitting on the table at the same time stood up and clamored, and the sword dust was no exception	
He called softly	
This young man is the owner of Changyang House and Changyang Pa	
Chang Yang Pa came directly to an empty place on the table and sat up with a gentle smile on his face	
He looked at Jian Chen with a soft look and said softly: “I’m still happy to live in Fuchu?”Jian Chen nodded slightly and said: "It's OK!"Chang Yang Pa has a slight smile on his face and continues: "Xiang Er, if it feels boring in Fuchu, go outside to get rid of it and see the outside world by the way	
""I know, oh!" said Jian Chen softly	
See Jian Qing so sensible, it is not like a child just over one year old, Chang Yang Pa mind has no words to say happy	
The family had a good meal for dinner	
A meal was soon eaten	
After dinner, Jian Chen returned to his room alone	
According to his age, he was supposed to sleep with his mother, Pik Wan, but Jian Chen took the initiative to ask himself to live alone in a room	
For this issue, Jian Chen’s attitude was very resolute	
In the end, his mother, Pik Wan Tian, ​​was really embarrassed but he finally had no choice but to agree	
At night, the sword dust sits cross-legged on the bed with his hands on his knees, his palms facing upwards	
He is doing five heart-to-to-air gestures, and silently runs the first layer of the purple sword	
Ziqing Jiandian is the largest stack of sword dust in the past 20 years of age	
It is a practice cheat	
It not only records a very profound heart, but also has some powerful power	
Sword tricks	
This purple-green sword code was inadvertently dropped into a pool under a cliff in the middle of a cliff and was found dead in a cave after waking up	
Then it used to feed fish every day	
After ten years of sword-dust quizzism and ability to leap to the top of the cliff, he flew up from the bottom of the cliff and returned to the ground again	
Jian Chen was an orphan and his parents died in the war era	
He was adopted by a kind old grandfather when he was a child	
When he came out of the cliff, he had been in the past ten years and he returned to the place where he was	
In the crippled village, the grandfather who adopted it had passed away for many years	
Finally, after relying on his grandfather who had adopted no one to worship, Jianshi left the small village and alone	
Since the sword dust accepted the world and his current identity, he began to practice Ziqing Jiandian	
Now he has practiced for half a year	
Chapter IV Steps The Purple Youth Sword is divided into twelve layers, one of which is the practice of the body	['', '[] [] []', 'Chapter 4: Further Training', 'The Azulet Sword Law was divided into 12 different layers
It is said that if we want to have high-strength martial arts, we must first have a strong body	 The first layer was cultivating the body
After all, any martial arts moves are based on the body, so The first layer of the Purple Youth Sword Code is about the practice of body-building	 A common saying was that if one wanted strong martial arts, then one must first have a strong body
Most of the martial arts practitioners in the rivers and lakes rely on exercise and do some mandatory actions to make their bodies stronger, so that they are physically strong, and even some people have a large body of muscles	 After all, martial arts relied on the efficient use of the body; hence why the first layer of Azulet Sword Law was pertaining to the body
The large lumps make the muscles on the upper and lower parts of the body clear and clear, visible to the naked eye, and even some people's body is as hard as reinforced steel	', 'Most martial artists relied on strengthening their bodies in order to improve their own strength
This method of physical exercise in Jian Chen’s view is no different from destroying one’s own body	 Therefore they would strengthen their bodies and end up with bulging muscles everywhere
It is simply reducing the function of one’s own body	 It was clear to the naked eye how strong someone was by build alone
Although this will make the strength of one’s physical body far exceed that of an ordinary person, it’s the same	 Some people had even built their bodies to the point of their bones being as hard as reinforced steel bars
The body will also cause great harm, and the life span of such people is often very short	', 'To Jian Chen, this type of method to train the body would only ruin the body and would only narrow the potential of the human body
Especially in entering the old age stage, there will be a series of problems on the body	 So although this method would increase one’s strength past a normal persons, at the same time, it would bring about a large amount of damage to the body
Among the martial arts practitioners in the rivers and lakes, although some people and martial arts have their own methods of body-building, these methods of consummating the body are all inconsistent with the sword dust, and the basics are not the correct path	 The people who trained this way generally had a short life span
Even the Yi Jin Sutra of the Shaolin Temple is no exception	 When they were in the elderly phase, diseases and impairment within the body would happen at a higher frequency for them
Although the Yi Jin Jing is both internal and external, internal forces can be practiced	', 'The wandering martial artists of the world have many different sects with their own way of cultivating the body but to Jian Chen, these methods were mediocre
In addition, bones and bones can be practiced	 These were not the right paths to takes; even the Shaolin way of Yijin Jing was no exception
However, in the Yi Jin Jing recorded in this category, bone marrow bones have not yet penetrated into the bone marrow	', 'TL Note: https://en
Yi Jin Jing is only able to exercise the flesh and bones on the surface of the human body	org/wiki/Yijin_Jing', 'Even though the principles of Yijin Jing were beautiful in how it cultivated the inner strength and how it also strengthened the outer muscles, but Yijin Jing’s way of strengthening the body was still the same
It has not reached the real body-building effect	 It didn’t strengthen the very core of a human and only focused on external force only
The practice of cultivating the body recorded on the Purple Green Swords Code is a very profound and magical method	 This could not be be considered the pinnacle of cultivating the body if it did not target the entire body
The emphasis is on absorbing the atmosphere of heaven and earth, and then transforming the air of heaven and earth into the bone marrow of the flesh and letting everyone in the body	', 'The methods written in Azulet Sword Law were truly profound and magical
The site, each cell, and even the internal organs and various organs of the body are all strengthened and denaturalized	 By absorbing both the Qi of the heavens and the earth and then transforming it, one could incorporate it within the bones of the body
This not only results in a good body-building effect, but also has endless benefits to the body and can maximize Limits extend life expectancy, and in the later stages of cultivation, your flesh will grow stronger with your increasing internal strength	 This allowed every organ and even every single cell in the body to be strengthened to their limits
It will be more clearly stated on the purple sword, if it is possible to cultivate the body to the highest level, It can even be used to live with the world	 The original frailty would be cast away and the body would reach the most optimal state while giving the body endless amounts of benefits like a longer lifespan
However, the method of body building is related to your own strength	 When one practiced the later methods, your corporeal body would reach new heights in strength; and as Azulet Sword Law indicated, if one could reach the highest levels of cultivating the body, then they could even live as long as the heavens and the earth
Only the more infuriating in your body can make your physical body stronger	', 'However this method was associated with one’s own strength
After all, the practice of self-cultivation recorded on the purple sword is based on the infuriness of the body	 If one’s Qi was stronger than the physical body, then Azulet Sword Law would use that Qi and incorporate that into the body to become stronger
Into the entire body, once your body's infuriating and physical strength reaches a balance, it is necessary to break this balance as soon as possible, and strive to increase the strength of infuriness, so as to further strengthen your flesh	 In the case that one’s physical body and one’s Qi strength were both at an equilibrium, then one would have to make a breakthrough to reach the next level
The air of heaven and earth is continuously absorbed by the sword dust, and it operates in a specific cycle in the body's meridians	 Only with this cycle would one be able to continuously improve their entire body without limits
Then it is controlled by sword dust and integrated into every cell and body of the body	', 'Jian Chen was slowly absorbing the world’s Qi in a neverending stream and was circulating it in a cycle throughout his body
Since coming to this strange world, the only thing that has excited the sword dust is the air of heaven and earth	 Then under Jian Chen’s control, the Qi would be incorporated into his cells and organs
The air of heaven and earth here is very strong, and it is more than a hundred times stronger than the world in which he lived before	', 'Ever since he had arrived at this strange new world, one of the few things that had excited Jian Chen was the World Essence
The fact that he had previously survived the world was undoubtedly a poverty-ridden rural land, a paradise, a hell, and the two could not be compared at all	 The World Essence was extremely dense, perhaps a hundred times more dense than the Qi back in his world
This is the only place where the sword dust should be pleased	 Compared to the previous world, Jian Chen had nowhere to go but the old mountain range where he had died
However, one of the things that puzzled the sword dust was that compared to the atmosphere of the heavens and the earth in the world of his former world, the two were roughly the same, but the sword dust still carefully discovered the world of this world	 One world was paradise, the other world was hell, the difference was simply that clear to see, so Jian Chen was extremely happy about that
There is some special energy in the air	', 'However what Jian Chen couldn’t understand was the difference between the World Essence of this world and the World Essence of his past world
This energy only occupies a small part of the air of heaven and earth, and it is closely connected with the air of the heavens and the earth, as if it is a seamless one	 While both were the same in feeling, Jian Chen was carefully discovering that the World Essence had an extra type of energy
There is no separation between the two	 This type of energy was a small part of the World Essence and was interconnected as if blended together so that they could not be separated
When this kind of energy was inhaled into his body, he did not produce any state of incompatibility	', 'When he had absorbed this new type of energy into his body, nothing negative happened
Therefore, sword dust did not rule out this special energy that is obviously different from the atmosphere of the heavens and the earth	 So because of that, Jian Chen had not tried to remove the clearly different energy from the World Essence
However, for this kind of energy, sword dust is also very curious, there is always a thought in the brain is hovering, that is, this energy is not so simple	 However, Jian Chen was now curious in the matter, thoughts and ideas were swirling around his head, but this new energy was not that simple to be figured out so easily
As the atmosphere of the transformed heaven and earth continues to integrate into the flesh, Jian Chen also clearly feels that every cell in his flesh and the intrinsic wonders and entrails of the body are constantly growing	', 'After the never ending World Essence had been absorbed into his body, Jian Chen could clearly feel every single artery and cell in his body become stronger
The air of heaven and earth that is transformed is like a big tonic to them	 The World Essence that was taken into his body was like a giant health tonic that made his body feel alive as it absorbed it
They seem to have lived one by one, and they are desperately absorbing the air of these heavens and earth, as if they are a hungry tiger	 His body was like a giant thirsty tiger that wanted more and more
At the same time, Jian Chen also feels extremely comfortable and comfortable	 While at the same time, Jian Chen was feeling a pleasurable sensation from all over, and felt free from worry as the feeling carried him away
In an instant, another year passed	', 'In a flash, another year had gone by
Today, it has been two years since the sword dust came to this strange world	 Jian Chen had been in this strange world for 2 whole years now
In the past two years, the sword dust has not been a step away from Changyang	 During those 2 years, Jian Chen didn’t take a single step outside of the Changyang mansion
It is the first layer of cultivation of the purple sword in its own room - practice	 Everyday during his free time, Jian Chen was alone in his room practicing the first principle of Azulet Sword Law–body cultivation
Maybe it's because the air of heaven and earth is a hundredfold more powerful than the world where the sword dust predecessor was	', 'Perhaps it was because this World Essence was a hundred times denser than the World Essence in his past world, but in one year Jian Chen had already reached major success in cultivating his body
This year has achieved tremendous achievements in refining the body	 At the current moment without a doubt, If an average person swung an average sword at him, then his body would not be scratched at all
Now there is no doubt in the sword dust, if it is ordinary weapons, in the ordinary In the hands of human beings, they can't do the least harm to themselves	 He had trained his body so much that even a single cut would not be made
Even the outermost skin of his body is unbreakable	', 'Of course, this was only what Jian Chen had thought of himself, he wouldn’t dare try it out on himself personally
Of course, this is only the feeling of sword dust	', 'In this past year, Jian Chen’s body was developing at such a fast rate, it was inconceivable
He will not try this stupidly	 In a single year, he had already reached a height of 1
In the past year, the body of Jian Chen’s body has also been developing at an incredible pace	2 meter, an abnormal height for a 2 year old
He is only two years old and he is already one meter tall	 This height had actually made him look to be closer to 5 or 6 years old instead
He does not seem like a two-year-old child at all, but is more like It is a child of five or six years old	', 'Because of this, everyone in the Changyang mansion had been alarmed beyond belief, although many of them still had vast expectations for him
This scene made everyone in Changyang up and down feel very amazed	 Expectations hoping that he would be a genius with unlimited potential, but everyone would have to wait for when he turned 3 in order to confirm anything
Almost all people hold very high expectations for sword dust	', 'Regarding this expectation put on him, Jian Chen couldn’t help but feel helpless
He hopes that he is really a genius with unlimited potential, but all this must wait for him to be three years old	 He didn’t understand that the reason why his body had grown so fast was due to practicing Azulet Sword Law because back in his previous world, he did not have Azulet Sword Law by his age
Can confirm it	', 'Although he still accompanied his mother Bi Yuntian to the dining hall, but as usual he had still shut himself off in his room every night
For all this, Jian Chen felt very helpless	 Sitting on the bed with crossed legs and his hands on his knees, he would close his eyes and face the sky once more
He did not understand whether his body was growing so fast because he had cultivated the practice method of the Purple Youth Sword because he had not touched purple at this age in his previous life	', 'But this time, Jian Chen wasn’t cultivating his body, but instead he was pondering
Qing Jiandian	 It had been 2 years since he arrived at this world, and in those 2 years, he had never seen the outside world from beyond Changyang mansion
After Jian Dian had dinner with his mother, Pik Wan Tin, in the dining hall, he was still habitually holding himself in the room, locked the door, placed his hands on his knees and legs, put his hands on his knees, and closed his eyes	 He spent the majority of his days locked up to cultivate his body
Five hearts are in full swing	 Up until now, he still did not understand much about this world
However, at this time, the sword dust may not be cultivated, but it is thinking that he has come to this world for two years	 Outside of Changyang mansion, he practically knew nothing about this world, even what the outside world looked like
In the past two years, Jian Chen did not take a step in Changyang City	', 'He understood in his heart that in everyone else’s eyes, he was a 2 year old boy
Most of the time throughout the day was in During the cultivation in the room, until now, he has learned too little about the world	 A 2 year old boy would generally be happily cherished by his parents while growing up carefreely
He can almost say that except for Changyang, he did not know what kind of world it was	 Jian Chen however, would not be in that situation at all
He did not even know what the outside was like	', 'As he was thinking on his bed, Jian Chen finally decided that tomorrow morning, he would ask his parents
In his heart, he is also very clear that he is still only a two-year-old child in the eyes of others	 It was important for him to know and understand what the outside world was like in this world
A two-year-old child usually grows up in the arms of his parents and enjoys carefree and carefree growth	', 'After thinking it out, Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes and got off the bed
After closing his eyes on the bed and thinking about the meeting, Jian Chen finally decided to wait until tomorrow morning to go and ask his own mother	 Tonight, he would not be cultivating his body on top of his bed as usual, but instead he would stand in the central point of his room with his eyes closed
He felt that he needed to know what the world was like	', 'In Jian Chen’s mind, a pair of mysterious footsteps began to appear
After thinking about this, the sword dust slowly opened his eyes and he got out of bed	 Then a picture appeared inside of Jian Chen’s mind
Tonight, he did not sit in bed as usual, but he stood straight in the middle of the room and closed in a microscopic way	 Just like a movie reel, the picture never seemed to stop, but all he could see was a figure wearing a white chang pao
In the brains of Jian Chen, a very mysterious pace gradually emerged	 It was a young man holding a sword that was quickly pacing through a mysterious land
Then, a picture suddenly appeared in the brain of sword dust	 He was walking so fast, that a regular person would have a hard time seeing him clearly
The picture seemed to be flowing like a movie and only one man was wearing white	 Because the young man was walking far too quickly despite the small amount of room he was in, a series of after images were trailing behind him
The robe and the young man carrying the sword walked fast and swiftly on the ground	', 'This figure was the previous incarnation of Jian Chen, and the steps that were appearing were actually symbolizing Azulet Sword Law, truly a mysterious image
The speed of the young people was very fast	', 'As the morning daylight shone through a crack of a window into his room, Jian Chen suddenly opened his eyes as he stood in the middle of the room
If ordinary people, I am afraid that the youth’s stature could not be seen at all because of the speed of the young people	 In this hour, he had finally moved; his legs moved so fast that it was practically a blur
It was too fast	 For his legs to maintain this type of speed for some time, even most martial artists wouldn’t be able to keep up in this condition
Although it was only moving in a small space, behind him was a series of phantom shadows	', 'Jian Chen’s legs were moving in a mysterious way as he walked about in a certain trajectory
This young man is the predecessor of Jian Chen, and this set of steps is also recorded in the Purple Youth Sword	 As he moved around his room quickly, his legs had whipped up a small whirlwind due to the extremely fast paced movement he was making
It is very mysterious	', 'Although this event did not go on for long, Jian Chen stopped moving, as his face was turning paler by the second
When the moonlight in the sky shines through the cracks in the window and enters the room, suddenly, the sword dust in the middle of the room suddenly opens his eyes	 Slowly gasping for breath, both of Jian Chen’s legs couldn’t help but shiver and quake as he paused
At this moment, he finally moves, and only sees his legs at an incredible speed	', 'Jian Chen slowly walked to his window and sat down next to it
Sliding quickly, almost a phantom has been formed, in order to maintain such a high-speed movement of the legs, even if some of the people who learned the military is absolutely not able to do this	 Bending his lower back, both of his arms massaged his legs continuously
Jian Chen’s legs are constantly on the ground with a mysterious and regular trajectory	 Pursuing the mysterious footsteps for that one moment had caused his legs to become incomparably weak
With the rapid movement of the pace, even his body is rapidly shuttled through the room at a very fast pace	 He couldn’t even use the smallest amount of power in his legs anymore
At that time, the speed had already caused a whirlwind in the room	', 'Jian Chen shook his head helplessly, no matter what type of martial art to cultivate himself, the first thing he had to do was attain a better build
However, this scene did not last long, the sword dust quickly stopped, at this moment he was already a little pale, slightly gasping, but his feet could not help but trembled slightly	 Not only that but the more profound a martial art was, the higher its requirement
Jian Chen slowly walked to the window and bent down, holding his legs with both hands	 When it came to the exercise of following the footsteps, if he did not have a strong physical physique and a strong Qi, then he would not have been able to last very long
Following that mysterious pace, it lasted for such a small period of time	 Of course, normal practitioners would not be able to hold up for as long as he had, and if they had tried, then they would have exerted their body beyond what it could take and damage it
The dust in the sword's legs was extremely soft, and I felt that I could not afford the slightest strength	', 'It was not easy to acquire a profound ability after all
Jian Chen reluctantly shook his head	', 'Sitting by his bed after massage his legs, he waited for his leg to be returned to their original state before sitting cross-legged on the bed again
No matter what martial arts he was practicing, he would first have to train on a good bone	 Once more he began to absorb the spiritual Qi from the world and absorb it into his body
This sentence was really right, and the more profound the martial arts, the higher the demand, he just stepped out	', 'The night went by quickly and in a flash the sky was filled with the colors of the day
The set of pace, if there is no strong body and strong infuriating support, will not last long, after all, an ordinary body can not only not play so fast, and once the speed of movement exceeds the physical body Ultimately, it will cause some damage to your body	 And at that moment, a sound could be heard coming outside of Jian Chen’s room
It is not so easy to train yourself in advanced skills	', '“Fourth master, it’s daytime, time to get up!”
Sitting on the edge of the bed will have legs, and after the legs return to normal, the sword dust sits cross-legged on the bed and enters the state of rejuvenating heaven and earth	 came the obviously feminine cry
The night passed in a hurry, and in the twinkling of an eye, the sky was already bright	', 'Hearing the sound, Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes and cried out in his childish voice, “I know, sister Hong Hua, I’m already awake!” With that said, he climbed down from his bed
At this time, a voice came in from the door of the Jian Chen	', 'Yet at this time, the door was opened, and two girls around the age of 18 came walking in
"Four young masters, it's morning, it's time to get up!" It's obviously a girl's voice to listen to the sound	 Both of them were carrying a small serving tray with a basin on it
Wen Sheng, the sword dust sitting cross-legged on the bed slowly opened his eyes, and said with childish voice: "I know, sister of red flowers, I'm up!" Then, the sword dust got up and got out of bed	 Rolled around the basin was a new clean and tidy towel meant for him to wash his face with
At the same time, the door was opened and two young girls, about 18 years of age, came in from the door	 The other tray had also another basin for Jian Chen to wash his teeth in to prepare himself for the day', '[] [] []', '', '']
They both had a big tray in their hands, and there was a pot on one of the trays	
Next to the pot, a brand-new towel was folded neatly over the face	
It was the furniture used to wash the face	
The other woman's tray contained brush and mouthwash utensils	
Chapter 5 Tianyuan Continent "Sister safflower, sister Dong Mei, it is hard for you	['', '[] [] []', 'Chapter 5: Tian Yuan Continent', '“Sister Hong Hua, sister Dong Mei, thank you for your troubles
" Watching two young girls aged 18 or younger, Jian Chen said softly	” Looking at the the 18 year old girls, Jian Chen thanked the two quietly
These two girls are the ring of Changyang Fuchu	', 'These two maids were the servants of the Changyang family and were specifically meant to cater to the everyday needs of Jian Chen
They are people who specially serve the day-to-day affairs of the sword dust	 Since Jian Chen was always by himself in his room, his mother Bi Yuntian had hired two servant girls to wait upon him
After the automatic sword dust lived alone in a room, his mother, Pik Wan-day, specifically sent the two maids to serve	', 'Hearing Jian Chen, the two girl laughed sweetly and then said, “Fourth master, by all means, don’t be so polite
After listening to the words of Jian Chen, two of them smiled sweetly	 We are just doing what we are supposed to do
One of them said: “You must not be so polite	”', '“That’s right, fourth master, please refrain from being so courteous in the future
As a ring, these are what we should do	 If the elders hear about the treatment you’re giving us, then we may be penalized harshly
”"Yeah, four young masters, after all, you must not be able to say this	” The other servant girl had said
If you let the adults in charge listen to you, we will be subjected to very serious punishment	', 'Jian Chen smiled, “Don’t worry, I wouldn’t talk like this if others were around
" Another ring also said	” Jian Chen was extraordinarily intelligent, and the Changyang mansion had strict rules regarding statuses
Jian Chen slightly smiled and said: "Rest assured, I will not say so in front of outsiders	 If the fourth master was to be heard saying such words, then it would be sure that the two girls would not be punished lightly
" Jian Chen also very clear, Changyang Fuchu rank concept is very strong, as a dignified Changyang Fuchu four masters, if this sentence is outsiders Hearing, said that these two rings could not be punished	', 'After washing his face, Jian Chen departed from his room and walked toward his mother’s room as usual
After the wash, Jian Chen left his room and walked toward his mother’s Pik Wan’s room as usual	 The distance between the two wasn’t far; it was only 20 meters away from his own room
His mother’s room was not far from his room, only a short distance of more than 20 meters	', 'Shortly after entering the room, Jian Chen saw his mother at the dressing table putting on makeup with the help of her own two servant girls standing next to her
Just entering the door, Jian Chen saw the mother on the dresser at a glance, and there were two beggars standing next to him	', '“Xiang’er, you’re here earlier than usual today
"Xiang Er, why come here so early today	” With a glance at Jian Chen, a gentle smile full of love and adoration could be seen
" On seeing Jian Chen, Pik Wantian's face showed a soft smile, and the look of Jian Chen's eyes was full of love	', 'Seeing that expression of love on her face, Jian Chen’s own heart became soft
Looking at the beloved look in the eyes of Pik Wantian, the heart of Jian Chen was completely softened	 In his previous world, Jian Chen had lost both parents when he was small and thus had never known about motherly love, or even experienced it
In the past life, Jian Chen lost his parents from childhood, and he simply did not know what mother love had ever experienced, but he never came to experience it	 But when he had came to this world, he had clearly felt the power of this motherly love
He really felt the power of maternal love	 And so because of that, he had started to treasure this feeling of love slowly over time
At the same time, in the heart of Jian Chen, the vaguely cherished the hard-won motherhood	', 'Jian Chen walked up to the side of his mother and rubbed his stomach and said with an embarrassed laugh, “Your son is hungry!” After the rigorous exercise from last night, he had been feeling the slight pangs of hunger
Jian Chen came to Biyuntian and reached out and touched his stomach	', 'Bi Yuntian placed a gentle hand on top of Jian Chen’s head and laughed, “Then in a moment mother will take you to the dining hall to eat
He smiled shyly and said: "Hao is hungry!" After that last night's movement, the stomach of Jian Chen is really hungry	”', '“Yea!” Jian Chen nodded his head, a look of satisfaction on his face
Pik Wan-day reached out and touched the head of Jian Chen	 In his heart, he secretly enjoyed the loving concern his mother had shown him
He smiled and said, "I will go to the dining hall to have dinner with my mother	', 'Pausing for another second, Jian Chen opened his mouth again, “Mother!”', 'Bi Yuntian looked at Jian Chen warmly and said, “Xiang’er, if you have something you want to say, say it!”', 'Jian Chen hesitated for a second before recollecting his inner thoughts
""Huh!" Jian Chen nodded slightly, his face showing a trace of satisfaction, but the heart is very much enjoy the mother's care	 Looking at his mother again, he said, “Mother, could you please tell your child what the outside world is like
After a pause, the sword dust again shouted: "Mother!"Pik Wan Tian looked softly at the sword dust and said softly: "Xiang Er, if anything, just say it!"The sword dust hesitated and settled the thoughts in his head	”', 'Hearing Jian Chen, Bi Yuntian was clearly shocked by his question
Then he looked at Pik sky with both eyes and said, "Now, can you tell the baby what kind of world is outside?"After listening to this, Pik Wan-tian obviously squatted and then said, “Well, are you interested in the outside world?”"The baby is just curious!" said Jian Chen	 Opening her mouth, she asked, “Xiang’er, could it be you’re interested in the outside world?”', '“Your son is only curious!” He answered
Pik Wantian smiled and said, "Xiang Er, the outside world is very vast and complex	', 'Bi Yuntian laughed, “Xiang’er, the outside world is extremely vast and also extremely complicated
It is not clear if we can speak in a few words	 The matters of the outside world could not be made clear through words alone
If you want to know what kind of world is outside, then it is best to Go to the library and read a book	 If you want to learn about it, then it would be best if you went to the library and read a few books on it
” Said Pik Wantian's helplessness and said: “But if you don’t know Xiang Zi, you don’t even know one of the words written in the book	” Even as she voiced her answer, Bi Yuntian’s face had looked a little bit helpless
”"Niang, why didn't you send a person to teach me to read?" Jian Chen's voice is a bit dissatisfied	 “But Xiang’er, you still don’t know how to read, even if you go to the library, you wouldn’t be able to read any of the words
Hearing, Pik Wantian fluttered a smile and said, “You're only two years old now, Xiang Er	”', '“Mother, then why don’t we bring some people to teach me how to read?” Jian Chen’s voice contained some dissatisfaction
The two-year-old boy will begin to read	', 'Giggling, Bi Yuntian said, “Xiang’er, you are only 2 years old
This girl may never have heard of it, and it’s on our Tianyuan continent	 Your mother has never heard or seen a 2 year old child learn how to read before
There has never been such a thing	 Even in the entire Tian Yuan continent, this type of situation has never happened before
In general, even the earliest literate children have to wait until the age of four or five	 Generally speaking, the earliest any child has ever started to learn to read was when they were around 4 to 5 years old
"The sword dust blew, and then said: "Mother, baby now wants to read, then can you find someone to teach me	”', 'Jian Chen understood instantly, “Mother, your son wants to learn to read
"After listening to these words, Pik Wantian suddenly stayed a little and even smiled with a smile of happiness: "Xian Er, literacy is a very hard thing, and it's very boring	 Could you please find some people to try and teach me still?”', 'Bi Yuntian was speechless, but a happy smile crept up on her face nonetheless
We must know that there are so many words on our continent	 “Xiang’er, learning to read is an exhausting task as well as being extremely boring
It is not a short time to complete the study	 You must understand that there are many different words in the continent
Are you sure you want to start literacy now?"Jian Chen absolutely nodded and said: "Yes!"After getting a positive reply from Jian Chen, the smile on Pik Wantian's face was brighter and brighter	 This isn’t something that can be learned quickly, are you sure you want to start learning now?”', 'Jian Chen nodded his head in confirmation, “I am!”', 'Hearing Jian Chen’s answer, Bi Yuntian’s smile became even more splendid
He said, “Since it is Xiang’s initiative, that’s why my mother is very supportive of you	 With a happy laugh, she said, “If this is what Xiang’er’s request is, then mother will support you entirely
” Then Pik Wantian turned slightly	” Turning her head, she called out, “Xiao Liu! In a moment, go to Lore City and hire the most prestigious teacher and bring him to the mansion so he can teach my Xiang’er how to read”!', '“Yes, my lady!” The servant girl who was combing Bi Yuntian’s hair agreed respectfully
"Ah, Koyanagi! After the meeting, you'll go and ask the most famous teacher in the city of Lorra to come to the palace	', '“Xiang’er, it’s been a decent amount of time, let us go to the dining halls before the both of us starve
Let him teach me Xiangle to read!""Yes, ma'am!" said the princess who helped Pik Wan to comb her hair respectfully and respectfully	”', 'The day went by quickly, and when the second day came, the teacher Bi Yuntian had hired arrived at the mansion and began to teach him to read
"Xian Er, now it's not too early	”', 'And so from that moment on, Jian Chen would spend his daytime earnestly studying how to read
Let's go to the dining hall, but don't hungry yourself	 Since he retained some mental fortitude and knowledge from his memories of the past
"The day passed quickly	 Learning the written language of this new world was not all that difficult
The morning of the next day, Mr	 Combined with the teacher who was putting his heart and soul in teaching him as well as his amazing memorization capabilities, learning to read was extremely fast and easy for him
Pik Wan’s mother, Pik Wantian, invited him to come to the house early and began to teach the knowledge of sword dust	 In just a short span of three months, he had already mastered the most basic words of the continent
Since then, almost all of Daylight’s daytime has been spent in serious literacy	', 'Jian Chen’s learning rate had made the teacher exclaim in astonishment
Because sword dust retains the memories of past lives and the spirit is strong before the spirit, it is not difficult for sword dust to recognize the words of this new continent	 Immediately after Bi Yuntian had learned that he had learned most of the written language in three months, she couldn’t believe it
In particular, under the careful guidance of others, it seemed to be more relaxed, and he had a hard memory that he could hardly forget	 In the end, she had put Jian Chen in a test before she could accept the fact
So the progress of learning the text was very fast, and it took only a short period of three months	 If one wanted to read and write most of the words used in the continent to the extent Jian Chen had, then one needed to spend at least 2 years
I learned completely about the common language on the mainland	 To have Jian Chen accomplish this in 3 months while it took most 2 years, not even any of the geniuses could claim to have accomplished this feat
The speed with which the sword dust learns the text is so amazing for the teacher, and immediately after his mother Bi Yuntian knew that the sword dust actually learned the text in just three months, it was even more unbelievable	', 'This achievement quickly reached the ears of Jian Chen’s father
In the end, it was only after personal tests that they accepted this fact	 Changyang Ba had then personally paid a visit to Jian Chen about it
After all, if you want to acquire all the common words on the mainland, it will take at least one or two years or more to look at the normal speed	', '“Xiang’er, you have endured much in such a short amount of time, it’s time to relax for now
In just a few months, it took homework that others had completed in a year or two	 Let your father give you a reward; since you have painstakingly learned to read in these past few months, I don’t know what reward Xiang’er would want though
It was impossible to accomplish without a genius-wise brain	” Changyang Ba’s face contained a smile as he looked down at Jian Chen as he spoke
This matter was quickly known by the father of Chang Chen, the father of Jian Chen	 Having such a genius for a son, he was extremely proud of himself and cared much more for Jian Chen than any other child automatically
Chang Yang Pa himself came to see him in the room of Jian Chen	', 'Hearing this, Jian Chen’s eyes brightened and thought for only a few seconds before responding, “Father, would you allow your son to go to the library and read some of the books there so I can get some experience and learn even more
"Xiang Erh, you have worked hard during this time	”', 'Changyang Ba’s eyes brightened as he looked at Jian Chen with gratification
Then relax and let the father give you a reward	 With a loud laugh, he said, “This is no problem at all, Xiang’er
As you work hard for literacy over the past few months, don't know Xiang you think	 You have a heart that desires to improve itself, and your father is proud of this
What kind of reward?” Chang Yang Pa looked at the sword with a smile and whispered	 I approve of your request, the library will be free to you whenever you desire
With such a talented son, he also feels very proud in his heart and naturally becomes more concerned about sword dust	”', '“Thank you father!” Jian Chen’s face exuded a happy expression
After listening to these words, Jian Chen’s eyes lit up, and he said without hesitation: “Well, it's better to let the children go to the library to read some books	 To be able to enter the library was an achievement that Jian Chen could truly be happy about
By the way, it can also increase some knowledge	 After all, he had understood that the library wasn’t a place anyone could walk in freely
”Chang Yang Pa eyes brightened, looked at Jian Chen's eyes with a hint of relief, laughing: "Of course it's no problem, Xiang Er, you have such a motivated heart, and the father is also happy for you, now I approve After the bookstore, you are free to enter	 One had to be 6 years old or older and had to be directly descended from the Changyang clan in order to enter
"“Thank you!” Jian Chen’s face also reveals a happy smile and can enter the library	 Of course, if one received the permission from the clan leader then the requirements could be waived
It is also a good thing for Jian Chen	', 'Soon after, Changyang Ba began to dote upon Jian Chen for a while before departing from his room
After all, during this time he slowly understood that the bookstore was not accessible by anybody	 After he had left, Jian Chen wasn’t able to sit in his room any longer
He must be a disciple who is over six years old to be eligible to enter, of course, if he is allowed by the owner	 Immediately exiting his room, he headed toward the direction of the library
Not included	 After studiously learning how to read for 3 months, it all led up to this moment of being able to enter the library and look up information pertaining to the outside world
Afterwards, Chang Yang Pa left the place again with a warm touch of sword dust	 Even if there wasn’t much details on the outside world in the books, Jian Chen could always go ask his mother
When Chang Yang Pa left, Jian Chen could not sit still	 But the books definitely had more details than his mother as well as being quite comprehensive
He immediately went out of the room and walked towards the library	 As a result, Jian Chen had placed more importance on the books
After all, these three months came to him	', 'The location of the library had already been answered for Jian Chen a long time ago; it was in the back of his family’s courtyard in a large pagoda
Efforts to read, everything is just to be able to enter the library to read books about the world's details	 When Jian Chen entered the courts in the back, he immediately felt the presence of many experts concealed in every directions and were staring at him with viper like eyes
Although some information about this world, the sword dust can also ask their own mother, but after all, the book records are much more detailed, but also must be more comprehensive, so that the dust will be so valuable to these books	', 'With his head high and proud, Jian Chen pretended that he didn’t sense the experts and walked further into the tower
The position of the bookstore was long ago heard, and it was in a high tower in the family's backyard	 If he let other people know that he could sense people that were looking at him from concealed areas, then a series of troublesome questions would follow
When the sword dust enters the backyard, he immediately feels that a large number of masters have been hidden in the surrounding areas	 He was a 2 year child after all without any knowledge about martial arts
His eyes are like snakes and they all fall on their own bodies	', 'Changyang Mansion had many direct descendants, but not many people were heading toward the library
The sword dust raised his head high, pretending to go to the front tower, without knowing it	 So the only people Jian Chen had seen were the guards that protected the area, and almost no other clan member
If one knew that he could feel the gaze of those who were in the dark, he would immediately draw a series of Trouble, after all, his current appearance is only a two-year-old child, and he himself does not understand the slightest martial arts	', 'Jian Chen quickly reached the doors to the tower before stopping to lift his head up to see the extremely large board hung above the doors of the tower
Changyang Fuchu’s ancestral disciples are quite a few, but this bookstore is rarely visited by people	 The words “Book Pavilion” were written in fancy writing, with 2 guards standing below it
As a result, apart from seeing several guards who are responsible for standing guards, Jian Chen has never seen anyone else	 When he looked at the two guards, he could tell these guards were definitely not lacking in strength
Soon came to the tower of the tower, sword dust stopped, looked up slightly, saw only a very large plaque hung on the entrance to the tower, above the dragon dance is written three characters "library", and in In front of the entrance gate, there are two guards guarding, but Jian Chen saw at a glance that these guards are not weak	', 'Waiting for the gates to open, Jian Chen then walked in directly without being obstructed by the two guards
Jian Chen went straight to the entrance to the tower, opened the door and went straight in	 They were almost like woodcarvings that stood motionlessly on the side with their backs straight
The two guards guarding the gate did not have any obstacles	 Even when Jian Chen had appeared, the two did not even greet him
They seemed to be standing like a wooden sculpture, standing there straight and motionless	', 'As Jian Chen entered the inner tower, a long and narrow corridor greeted his eyes
Even when we saw the sword dust, we did not even call a greeting	 It was daytime on the outside, and light shined down beautifully, leaving a sight like none other
When the sword dust enters the tower, a long corridor comes into view	 On the walls of the corridor, a bright moon pearl was hung and gave off a light to illuminate the hallway
At this moment, the outside is bright during the day and the sun is shining	', 'The length of the corridor was quite long, before finally splitting into two paths
However, in the corridor, it is extremely dark	 Jian Chen estimated that both paths followed the opposite sides of the tower before finally rejoining again after a distance
On the walls on both sides of the corridor, there are intervals	', '“Fourth master, the clan leader has said you have the authority to access the left side of the tower
With a fist-sized night pearl, it provides the light here	” An elderly voice called out
This corridor is very long	 Coming out from the shadows slowly was a tall figure
It is estimated that it runs through the tower and divides the tower into two areas	', 'Jian Chen turned around after hearing this; although the light in this part of the tower was dim, he could clearly make out the appearance of the figure in the midst of the shadows
When the sword dust reaches the end of the corridor, it meets two ramps	 It was an elderly figure with white hair and wrinkles all over
“The four young masters have orders from the family	 Wearing a silver chang pao that was devoid of any other colors, even still he was relatively normal looking, no one would suspect he wasn’t anything more than an ordinary elderly man
You have permission to enter the left area	', 'No matter how much Jian Chen looked at the old man, he couldn’t see anything but mediocrity
” At this moment, an old voice sounded	 Although he still didn’t dare underestimate the old man
With the voice, a tall figure gradually appeared in the darkness	 It was his inner instincts that told him that this old figure was an expert with extraordinary strength
Hearing the sound, Jian Chen’s intention to turn around and see, although the light here is very dark, but it can clearly see the face of the man in the dark, I saw it was a very old old man, with white hair , And an old face is full of wrinkles, wearing a fine old gray robe, and a pair of eyes are bland, giving a feeling is a very ordinary old man	 The strongest man he had seen since he had entered this world was his father Changyang Ba, but it was impossible to measure his father to what Jian Chen was feeling from this old man
Although the old man looks very ordinary no matter what, but Jian Chen can not underestimate the old man, he can clearly feel that this old man is a very powerful master, but also he came to the world Since then, the most powerful person ever seen, even if his father Chang Yang Pa, is far from being able to compare with the old man	', '[] [] []', '', '']
Chapter VI St	['', '[] [] []', 'Chapter 6: Saint’s Test', 'Although Jian Chen could see through his frail appearance and find the true strength of the old man, he remained motionless and did not reveal anything on his face
Force Test Although the sword dust found the strength of the old man, but did not show any expression on his face, silently nodded, gently hum, then passed by the elderly, walked to the left corridor	 With a silent nod to show his thanks, he stepped by the old man and proceeded down the left corridor
When he came to the end of the corridor, the light in front of Jian Chen suddenly brightened	', 'Arriving at the end of the corridor, Jian Chen’s eyes began to shine brightly as he walked into a large room
He had already arrived in a very spacious room	 The light in this room was exceptionally bright, so much so that it was comparable to the light outside
The light was very bright and it was no different from the white day outside	 Many neat and tidy bookshelves that contained thousands of books lined the walls of the library
In this room, Neatly arranged a large number of bookshelves, placed on a large number of books, if the sum of the books in the entire room, it is estimated that there are at least a few thousand	', 'Jian Chen slowly tilted his head to look at the ceiling
Jian Chen slightly looked up at the ceiling because he knew that the light was so bright, it was all due to the ceiling, and the ceiling of the roof didn't know what material it was made from, but it actually gave off a soft glare	 He knew that the reason why the light was so bright was due to the ceiling
Although the light is strong, it is not dazzling	 He had no idea what material the ceiling was made from, but it was strangely emitting a strong glow
Although he was very curious about the ceiling, Jian Chen did not waste time on it, went straight to a bookcase, carefully selected a number of books, and eventually took out a book that he now most needed	 Although the light was somewhat intense, it was not to the point of irritating the eyes
This book contains very clear descriptions of the entire continent	', 'Although the ceiling had piqued his interest, he wasn’t willing to squander time by trying to figure it out
The books are not thick	 Walking up to a bookshelf, he finally grabbed a book and started flipping through it
The sword dust has changed in two or three hours	', 'The book had fairly clear descriptions written inside, despite it not being as thick as the others
At the same time, there is a general understanding of this unfamiliar world	 It had taken Jian Chen 3 hours to completely read through the book
The continental continent is called Tianyuan continent	 Because of this, he had finally gained some insights regarding this strange world
The mainland is very vast	', 'This continent was called the Tian Yuan continent and was fairly big
There are countless countries, large and small	 There were numerous countries of various sizes and even more cities of all sizes
Within these countries, there are a variety of cities of various sizes	 The biggest cities were known as the Capitals and each one stretched across countless miles, and each of these Capitals were ruled by a city ruler
The largest of these cities is called the super major city	 Each ruler was also in charge of several million up to ten million guardian soldiers
The size of each super-city is very large, and the supreme ruler of these cities is the city-owner, with several million or even tens of millions of city guards	', 'However, within the entire Tian Yuan continent, there were only 7 Capitals while 3 of the 7 were controlled by a single strong empire
However, on the entire Tianyuan continent, there were only seven super major cities	 Among the strongest empires were the Karl Empire and the Felicity Empire who both controlled two Capitals each
They were respectively occupied by the three most powerful empire, of which the Carrara Empire and the Felica Empire respectively controlled two super-main cities, and the last sacred empire	 It was the Holy Empire that controlled the first 3 Capitals
It is also the three main superpowers in charge	', 'Under the Capitals were the King Cities, but the King Cities were smaller than the Capitals by a huge amount
Under the super main city, followed by the king city, but the king city area is smaller than the super main city, the number is also more than the super main city, in almost every kingdom has at least one king city, There are millions of city guards, and under the king city is a first-class city with 800,000 city guards, second-tier cities, 400,000 city guards, three cities, 200,000 city guards, and three cities	 Practically every kingdom had at the very least one King City and each King City had a million guardian soldiers
The town below is Zhencheng	 Under the King Cities were the First Class Cities which had 800,000 guardian soldiers
Zhencheng has 100,000 guards of the city	 The Second Class Cities had 400,000 guardian soldiers each
Below the towns there are villages of different sizes	 Under the Second Class Cities were the varying villages which all had their own guardian soldiers but their numbers wouldn’t reach over 50,000
All guards are composed of village names, but the total number does not exceed 50,000	 Even their strength and numbers varied greatly
The strength and equipment are also much worse	', 'The Tian Yuan continent had people that all practiced something called the “Saint Force”
Everyone on the Tianyuan continent is a force called the “strength power” for cultivation	 When their Saint Force reached the 10th level, then based on the expert’s ideology, the saint force will condense into a Saint’s Weapon
When the power of the Holy Spirit in their body reaches tenth level, they will condense into a sacred soldier in the body according to the master’s thinking	 There were over 1000 shapes and each were completely dependent on the expert’s ideology
The shape of the sacred soldier is varied and the specific shape is entirely based on the master's thinking	', 'As a result of the Saint Weapon forming from the “Saint Force”, once it formed, it formed a special link with the expert
Since the sacred soldiers were completely condensed by the "holy power" in the human body, once the sacred soldiers were formed, they were all spiritually connected with their masters	 Some people with an outstanding gift would receive a Saint Weapon with a special attribute
And some talented people, when the sacred soldiers are condensing, will bring some attributes	 These attributes were classified as Earth, Wind, Water, Fire, Light, and Dark
These attributes are earth, wind, water, fire, light, and darkness	 Among these elements, light and dark were rarely seen, but were still extremely powerful
Dark elements are very rare and very powerful	', 'The light element was extremely strong in the healing aspect, and those who had light attributed Saint Weapons were given the title of Immortals in the Tian Yuan continent
The elements of the light system have a very powerful ability to heal, and those who possess the light elements of the sacred soldier have the title of undead on the Tianyuan continent because once they are injured in the battle, they will quickly recover through healing power	 They were given this title due to the fact that while on the battlefield, they could easily restore any damage taken
In the same level of fighting, if it is not a kill, it will be very difficult to kill them	 On the battlefield, if they were not killed in one strike, then they would be nearly impossible to defeat
The dark elements are strongly corrosive	', 'Those with the dark element had a corrosive nature
Not only is it very troublesome to deal with, but it is also the most difficult kind of person	 Not only was this a troublesome element, but those with dark attributes were also in demand
Especially in the darkness, they are still there	 At night, they could come and go as they pleased, earning them the titles of Night Lords, for the night was under their command
They have no trace, and there is a dark night on the mainland	', 'The rest of the 4 elements each had their own corresponding strengths
The title of the king, the night, is their world	 The amount of power they had depended on one’s own strength and judgement
The remaining four attributes also have their respective abilities	 Of course in the Tian Yuan continent, those who had a Saint Weapon with an attribute was 1 in 10 compared to those who didn’t have an attribute
The size of the ability is judged according to your own strength	 On a battlefield, those with an attribute were often harder to fight against than those who didn’t
Of course, on the Tianyuan continent, there are none of the sacred soldiers who possess attributes, and more people have no sacred soldiers	', 'The Saint Weapons were the strongest of weapons
Any attribute, and in the same level of battle, the person who owns the attribute is often much more powerful than the person without the attribute	 In a war, Saint Weapons could be freely summoned at will and provide assistance to their masters to help overcome their limits
The sacred soldier is the most powerful weapon of every person	 At the same time, a Saint Weapon and its master’s life were intertwined
When fighting, he can instantly summon the sacred soldier out of the body to help the host to fight and let the host play super power	 Whatever injury the Saint Weapon sustained would then be equally reflected back to the master
At the same time, the sacred soldier and the owner are also related to their lives	 Also, if the Saint Weapon ever broke, then the master would receive a fatal wound as well
The soldiers suffered a great deal of trauma and caused some damage to their masters	 If the situation was grave, then even a wound may cause death
If the sacred soldiers were cut off, the masters would be lethal and the situation would be serious	', 'However, Saint Weapons were extremely hard to break
They would even die	 As long as the Saint Weapon was stronger than the opposing force, then it would not be harmed in any way
However, the sacred soldier is very hard, unless the strength is stronger than the number of sage leaders, otherwise, it will not cause any harm to the sectarians	', 'After a Saint Weapon takes shape, then this new way of cultivation would absorb the Qi from the world to become stronger
After the formation of the sacred troops, the methods of cultivation in the future will increase the strength of the sectarians by absorbing the aura between heaven and earth	 This method would improve one’s own strength as well
After the formation of the sacred soldier, it became a "holy man	', 'Once the Saint Weapon was formed, then the expert would be called a “Saint”
" On the Tianyuan continent, the strength of the Holy One is also divided into nine ranks: the Holy One, the Holy One, the Holy Master, the Great Holy Teacher, and the Holy Land	 In the Tian Yuan continent, the Saints are classified into 9 different levels: Saint, Great Saint, Saint Master, Great Saint Master, Earth Saint Master, Heaven Saint Master, Saint Ruler, Saint King and Saint Emperor
Teacher, Sky Master, Holy King, Holy Emperor, Holy Emperor	 Within each of the levels, they are further separated into 3 levels: Lower, Middle, and Upper
Each level is divided into three small levels, which are the previous period, the middle period and the later period	', 'Within the Tian Yuan continent, there lies a mountain range that was spread out across the continent called the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts
On Tianyuan mainland, there is a huge mountain range that almost traverses the entire mainland	 The range was filled with countless magical beasts
This mountain range is called the World of Warcraft Mountains	 The further you went in, the stronger the beasts would get
It has endless World of Warcraft, and the more it goes deeper, the more powerful World of Warcraft is	', 'These magical beasts were also separated into 9 levels
World of Warcraft's level is divided into nine levels, a level of Warcraft's strength is equivalent to the Holy One of humanity, the power of two World of Warcraft is equivalent to the human Holy One, in order to push, eight World of Warcraft is equivalent to the human Holy , and nine World of Warcraft is equivalent to the human saint	 The class 1 beasts were equivalent to a Saint, while the class 2 beasts was equivalent to a Great Saint
At the same time, there is a very popular occupation on Tianyuan mainland, which is the mercenary	 Continuing on with this, a class 8 beast was on par with a Saint King and finally, a class 9 beast was equivalent to a Saint Emperor
According to the book, there are many mercenaries on Tianyuan mainland, almost all over the mainland	', 'At the same time, the Tian Yuan continent had a very prominent profession called the Mercenary
These mercenaries usually rely on various kinds of work	 According to this book, the Tian Yuan continent had many mercenaries
Different tasks to get money, but more mercenaries are to enter the World of Warcraft to kill the World of Warcraft, get magic nuclei to make money	 These mercenaries would accomplish a variety of tasks for money, although many mercenaries would enter the Mountain Range of Magical Beasts to hunt monsters and sell the monster cores for money
Although such dangers are very great, the profits are also very rich, because the magic nucleus is very high on the Tianyuan mainland, and the more advanced the magic nucleus, the more noble the price, and some high-grade magic nucleus even at all Not measured by money	', 'Although the dangers were big, the rewards were just as generous due to monster cores being highly valued in the continent
Magic nucleus, which is almost an item that all people on the Tianyuan continent are in great need, contains a very pure and powerful energy	 The higher grade a monster core was, the higher priced it was
This energy can be directly absorbed, so that it can quickly strengthen its own strength, and it is better than absorbing the air of heaven and earth	 There were some high ranked monster cores that could not be bought with money alone
There are several times faster, but using magic nucleus to cultivate, this is not the average person can afford it	', 'Monster cores were one of the most desired items in the continent
In addition to these, Jian Chen also understands from the books that this world is very cruel	 Inside the center of a monster core was a large amount of pure energy and could be absorbed by humans for a faster training speed
There is almost every battle here	 Absorbing the energy from a monster core was ultimately faster than trying to absorb the World Essence into one’s body
It is even more sinister than the rivers and lakes where he lived before	 However, using the monster cores to increase the cultivation speed wasn’t a method the general populace could do without having plenty of money
If there is no strong power, it will be in the outside world	', 'Other than a few odd things, Jian Chen was finally beginning to understand many things about this world
It is difficult to survive	 This world was exceptionally cruel and wars happened everywhere
Moreover, this continent is also cultivated by everyone	 The people of this world were more dangerous in comparison to his old world
However, many people have mediocre qualities	 If one wasn’t strong enough, then they would find it hard to survive
They cannot cultivate the strength of the Holy Spirit within the body to ten layers throughout their lives, and thus condense sacred soldiers in the body	 Most of the people on the continent were practitioners as well, although the average practitioner would be of average strength
There is no backing, and it is often the lowest level of living on the Tianyuan continent	 The average person wouldn’t be able to cultivate their Saint Force to the 10th level and be able to condense it into a Saint’s Weapon
It is equivalent to the peasant's land in the rural area	 If these people don’t have the proper training and support, then they would remain at the lowest levels similar to a peasant in the mountains
After reading these materials, Jian Chen had some understanding of this strange world	', 'After finishing the books, Jian Chen finally understood the new world to a better degree
The sacred warriors, the power of the elements, the Warcraft, the magic nucleus, and the mercenary were all so fresh to the sword dust	 Saint Weapons, elements and attributes, magical beasts, monster cores and mercenaries, everything was a new experience to Jian Chen that gave his heart a thrill
At the same time, the heart of the sword dust began to smash up, it is the yearning for the outside world, he is now anxious to immediately leave Changyang House, go outside to take a swing, feel some of the outside world style	 He was looking forward to the new world and desperately wished to leave the Changyang mansion immediately
However, Jian Chen knows that at least in the past few years, he is impossible to achieve this desire, not to mention that his parents will not let him even a child who is not even three years old to go out to swing, I am afraid that even if he really went out, There is no ability to protect yourself	 To be able to experience the outside world would be a refreshing change of pace
In the following period of time, the sword dust practiced harder	', 'However, Jian Chen knew that he would not be able to fulfill his desires in the upcoming years
In addition to eating and some daily activities, the rest of the time spent almost all of his time in the room	 His parents would never allow a three year old child to leave their home for the outside world
Now he has not yet completed the first stage of the purple sword	 Even if he could leave his home, he would have no way of defending himself
The basic part, so the air of heaven and earth inhaled by him is all integrated into every cell in his flesh	', 'After a long period of time, Jian Chen decided to put even more effort into his training
In essence, every part of the body is strengthened by the internal organs and limbs	 Aside from his daily meals, everyday was spent training alone within his room
When his flesh reaches these heavens and earths, he has not formed any strengthening effect on him	 He still hadn’t completed the basics of the cultivation stage of Azulet Sword Law, so the World Essence he had been absorbing was distributed equally throughout his body, entering each cell and strengthening his body
The sword dust will perform the second step and formally cultivate infuriating spirit	', 'It was only when his body could no longer be strengthened by the World Essence would Jian Chen be able to break through to the second stage, where he would start the formal training of his True Qi
So far, the sword dust has a far more powerful than ordinary people	 Currently, Jian Chen still had the physique far beyond that of a normal person, however some regions of his body where Qi previously gathered in his past world were still empty
Outside the body, Tanaka was empty, but there was no infuriating	', 'In his previous world, Jian Chen had managed to finish the cultivation stage within a single year
In the past life, sword dust cultivation of the purple green sword code took only one year to complete this step in the practice of the body, and in this world the atmosphere of the world is much stronger than his predecessors, so now he spent two The time of the year has not yet been completed, but the physical strength is definitely much stronger than in his previous life	 Since this World Essence\xa0was stronger by at least twofold, even though it was taking him more than 2 years to make a breakthrough, his body was getting stronger and stronger, giving his current body the potential to be even stronger than his previous body
For the sword dust did not come out to hide in their own room, his parents did not show the slightest look, because every two-year-old child in Changyang Fuchu, parents will pass on a basic basis of their breath Law, and then let them practice for one year, and when they reach the age of three, they will perform the Holy Power test to assess their potential and qualifications	', 'Although Jian Chen normally spent the entire day hiding in his room to cultivate, neither of his parents had outwardly expressed any sort of bafflement or concern
In the same way, when Jian Chen was just two years old, his mother, Pik Wantian, also uttered a most basic method of exhalation	 The reason for this was because in the Changyang mansion, the parents would generally teach the children a method of breathing and let them train for a year
However, for this method of exhalation, the sword dust flashed directly in his head	 By the third year, these children would take a test to see how strong their Saint Power was and evaluate their potential as well as their aptitude
He was left behind, because this thing for him, non-condensing is an adult with a toy for children to play with	 When Jian Chen was 2 years old, Bi Yuntian had taught him the same breathing method as the other children had learned
Therefore, Jian Chen shut himself in the room all day long and closed the door	 However, Jian Chen had taken this breathing exercise and tossed it into the depths of his mind, for Jian Chen had felt that this sort of training was like giving an adult a child’s toy to play with
Outsiders would think that Jian Chen was practicing the piece of breathing and he was not puzzled	', 'As a result, Jian Chen had locked himself in his room
The next morning, Jian Chen ended his night's cultivation	 People passing by had only thought that Jian Chen was practicing the breathing method, and paid no attention to him
Today is his special day because today is exactly the birthday of his three-year-old	', 'The following morning, Jian Chen had finally finished last night’s cultivation exercise
At the same time, today he will be carrying every three-year-old child on Tianyuan mainland	 Today was a special day for him, since it was his 3rd birthday
The Holy Power Test must be performed	 At the same time, today would be the day that he would undergo the very same test as any other 3 year old in the Tian Yuan continent–the Saint’s Test
After breakfast with her mother, Bi Yuntian, at the dining hall, Jian Chen walked toward the main hall of the Changyang House under the guidance of his mother	', 'Accompanying his mother Bi Yuntian to the dining halls, Jian Chen was then later taken to the Changyang clan’s official main hall
The area of ​​Changyang’s government is very large	', 'The Changyang mansion covered a large amount of area, and compared to the area Jian Chen was used to, he had only experienced a small portion of the land
The area where Jian Chen has lived is a small courtyard in Changyang	 Walking along the road, Jian Chen looked at the mansion without stopping
It is on the road, and Chang’an’s government is constantly on the lookout for the past three years	 In his first 3 years, Jian Chen had spent the vast majority of his time within his own room and cultivated, very rarely did he stroll around the mansion
Jianchen spends most of his time practicing in the room and rarely visit Changyang	', 'Within the Changyang mansion, a large group of uniformed patrolmen were walking around the area
In Changyang Prefecture, a team of armored guards patrolled each area and patrolled in each area	 Many sharp eyes were staring all around from hidden areas, and despite it being the daytime, they still did not show the slightest sense of relaxation
Their eyes were constantly glanced back and forth in secret places	', 'As Jian Chen walked past a series of training grounds, a young, but soft shout had gotten his attention from the inside
Even though it was daytime, they still did not relax	 A mere glance inside would show a small group of 10 year olds being taught some martial art drills by a middle aged man
When the sword dust passed through a broad field of rock formations, it was greeted with a buzzing sound of buzzing	', 'Jian Chen understood in his heart that these children were disciples born directly into the family line
He saw only dozens of children under 10 years of age under the guidance of a middle-aged man	 The Changyang clan had about 1000 clansmen
In the heart of Jian Chen, it is clear that these children are some of the disciples of the Changyang Fuchu	 Although half of them were guardsmen and servants, the other half were members that were born from within the clan line
There are a total of more than a thousand people in and around the Changyang Palace	', 'Walking past the training grounds, Bi Yuntian led her son to the middle of an official looking hallway
Apart from half of them are family guards and maids, the other half are almost all members of the Changyang government	 This was where Jian Chen would undergo the Saint’s Test
After passing through Yanwu Stadium, Jian Chen, led by his mother’s Pik Wan Tian, ​​finally came to the main conference hall in the center of Changyang	', '[] [] []', '', '']
Chapter VII Forgotten Genius The hall is very vast, and the area inside it is immense	['', '\xa0\xa0', 'Chapter 7: Forgotten Genius', 'Even though the outside hall was vast, the interior of the Changyang main hallways were even larger
At the moment, there are a dozen or so people sitting in the main hall	 Currently there were dozens of people strewn about, among them were a few middle-aged men who were dressed differently that stood out from the rest
They are all middle-aged men with different looks	', 'Bi Yuntian led Jian Chen to their seats in the front of the hallway
Pik Wantian walks with a sword dust straight to a seat near the main seat	 Those who had wanted to sit at the front had to have a high status in the clan, and since Jian Chen was the fourth son of the clan leader, he had the right to sit at the front
If you want to have a seat here, you must have a certain status	 However, his own seat wasn’t created yet, so he had to share a single chair with his mother
The sword dust is the four sons of Changyang	', 'The lovable Jian Chen sat down on his mother’s lap gently and didn’t say anything
But now there is no place for him	', 'In a flash, a line of people came streaming into the hall one by one before stopping in front of their seats
Therefore, Jian Chen and his mother, Pik Wan, sit in the same seat	 Among the newcomers was Jian Chen’s third aunt carrying her child along
Jian Chen is very clever sitting on the side of the mother Pik Wan, quietly waiting, do not speak	', '“Hey…fourth brother, today is the day you take the Saint Test
Soon, people in the hall continued to walk in, and then found their own position to do it quietly, and even the three aunts of Jian Chen also came in with their children	 You have to work hard so you don’t let second sister down
four brothers, today is the day you carry out the Holy Power test, you also have to strive to ah, do not let the second sister disappointed Oh	” Changyang Mingyue’s pretty face smiled at Jian Chen as she spoke in a soft but enthusiastic voice
" Changyang moon a cute smile on his face is full of smiles, facing the sword dust Said very lightly	 Although she was soft spoken, everyone in the hall had clearly heard who and what she was talking about
Although the voice is very light, but in this quiet hall, but let everyone hear clearly	', '“Ming Yue!” Her mother looked at her sharply as she spoke with soft rebuke
"Mingyue!" Chang Yang's mother looked at her with a frown and his tone shouted with a bit of blame	', 'Changyang Mingyue laughed and stuck her tongue out at Jiang Chen
Changyang Mingyue smiled gently, spurted his tongue out at the sword dust, and did not continue to speak	 Without any further words, she peacefully sat down right next to her mother’s side as her bright eyes blinked rapidly as she sized up the other people in the hall
He quietly sat beside his mother, and her bright eyes fluttered, constantly looking at the people in the hall	', 'Soon enough, everybody in the hall were all seated while they all looked at Jian Chen from time to time with looks of expectations shown clearly on their faces
Soon, the people in the main hall were filled, and the eyes of all the people in the temple swept through the sword dust from time to time	 The reason why many people were gathered was due to Jian Chen’s Saint Test
Their eyes were full of a look of expectation	', 'If it was any other child of the clan, then there would not had been such a massive turnout for the Saint Test
This time they gathered together because they were all today	 But Jian Chen wasn’t a regular child with no status; he was the child to the clan leader of the Changyang clan as well as having an innate talent blessed by the heavens
It is the day when sword dust reaches the age of three for the Holy Power Test	 The whole clan had practically placed all of their expectations on this child, hence why when it was Jian Chen’s turn to undergo the Saint Test, every clan member would be there
If an ordinary student is a disciple, he will not be so high when he performs the Holy Power test	', 'After all, Jian Chen had many different achievements under his belt, and the Saint Test would be another important milestone for him
However, the identity of the sword dust is different from that of the owner of the house of Changyang	', 'When everyone had settled down, Jian Chen’s father Changyang Ba stepped towards the middle of the hall and sat down on the throne that signified his status as the clan leader with a great blade right next to him
Moreover, he is also a gift from other people	', 'Changyang Ba’s eyes stopped on Jian Chen for only a second but Jian Chen could see the faintest of smiles on it
All the people in and around the government are holding a very high expectation	 Immediately afterwards, a voice spoke out, signifying the start of Jian Chen’s Saint Test
Therefore, when the sword dust carries out the Holy Power test, naturally these people with certain identities in the Changyang Mansion are very concerned	', '“De Shu, I’m sorry to have you take control of the Saint Test ceremony
After all, how successful are the sword dust in the future? Today's Holy Power test will be a very important start	” Changyang Ba said politely towards the elder
When everyone came together, Jianyang’s father, Chang Yang Pa, came to the Great Hall and took his seat on the throne where he represented the family leader	', 'The elder looked to be around 60 to 70 years old white haired man who wore gray clothing
Changyang Pa eyes stayed on the sword dust slightly, with a faint smile on his face, and then looked around for a week	 Although his face was full of wrinkles, his eyes were bright and filled with excitement
After saying some scenes, the sword dust test quickly began	', 'The old man laughed, “The clan leader is too modest
"Uncle Tzu, trouble you for the ceremony of the Holy Force test for the dog	” Walking towards the center now, he carried a smile on his face as he looked at Jian Chen before calling out in a friendly tone, “Fourth Master, if you please!”', 'Bi Yuntian looked at Jian Chen with a great look of affection and whispered, “Xiang’er, please go to where De Shu is standing so he can test for your Saint Force
" Changyang tyrant was rather polite to the old man sat down and said	”', '“Okay!” Jian Chen said lightly
The old man looks six or seven years old	 The clever child got off of his seat and with his small paces, he slowly approached to where the Elder De stood
He is wearing a grey shirt, his head full of white hair, and his face is covered with wrinkles, but his eyes are full of gods	', 'Without further ado, De Shu lifted his right hand where a small silver ring began to glow with a dazzling white light
The old man smiled and said: “The family is polite	 Waving it over, the smallest of trembles could be heard coming from the ground before slowly increasing in sound
” Then, the old man got up and walked to the center of the hall	 Right where there was nothing in front of them, a white stone half a meter large suddenly appeared
He smiled and looked at the sword dust	 It was clear to see that the white stone had been polished countless of times; the entire rectangular shaped rock, the width and thickness was both at a meter long
He said, “Four young masters, please!”Bi Yuntian looked at the sword dust sitting beside him with a loving face	', 'Looking at the newly emerged white stone, Jian Chen’s eyes blinked in surprise, he had felt quite curious about this stone but De Shu’s right hand had also caught his interest
The voice was gentle: "Xiang Er, hey, go to De Shu there, let De Shu test the Holy Power in your body	 He stared intensely at the ring on his middle finger, it was the ring he had seen from the books
""Uh-huh!" Jian Chen gently hummed, very well-behaved to leave the seat, and after a small step came to the old man called De-tert	', 'The Space Ring was made from rare but special materials, and could store items within the space of the ring
Uncle Tert was no nonsense	 The smallest object it could store was a meter cubed, while the biggest object it could store was a hundred meters cubed
He slowly raised his right hand	 One could store and take out any inanimate object as they pleased
Then, he saw a silver-white ring worn by De Shudong on his right hand	 This was an item that was so expensive in the Tian Yuan continent that the common person would not be able to afford it
He suddenly turned white, and then, De Shuwan's right hand gently waved and he heard only a sound	', 'Seeing Jian Chen looking at the Space ring adorned on his middle finger, De Shu laughed
A slight vibration was heard from the ground	 Whenever he had summoned the white stone for the Saint Test, everyone around would give him the same exact look
Immediately afterwards, a half-meter-high white stone was found on the ground, which was empty, and the white stone was clearly polished and rectangular	 In fact, he had seen the look so many times, he had lost count
It was half a meter high	', '“Fourth master, please place a hand on the Saint Stone
Both thickness and width are about one foot	” De Shu smiled
Looking at this, White Stone suddenly appeared, and the sword dust blinked	', 'The Saint Stone is a special rock that could measure the amount of Saint Force within a person’s body
It seemed very strange for the white stone to suddenly appear	 Within the large Tian Yuan continent, there are many different items that could measure one’s personal strength
Then, the sight of Jian Chen was moved to the right hand of De Shu, staring straight at the piece	 The Saint Stone used colors to represent a person’s strength–Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, and Purple
De Shu wears a silver-white ring on the middle finger	', 'Having the stone flash red meant that the person was still below a Saint in strength while an orange color meant that the person was at the same level as a Saint
And the brain quickly emerged a message seen in the book	 The yellow color represents a Great Saint and blue meant the person was an Earth Saint Master
The space ring is made of very special and rare material	 Lastly, a purple color represented a Heaven Saint Master
The ring is self-contained	 Any rank higher than the Heaven Saint Master like a Saint Ruler, Saint King, and Saint Emperor could not be ranked by the Saint Stone
The space is very big and small	', 'Hearing De Shu, Jian Chen focused back on the task and extended his hand onto the white stone called the “Saint Rock”
The smallest is only one meter cube	', 'At that moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on the Saint Rock
The big one can even reach the cubic meter of 100 meters	 They all stood up in anticipation, anxious to find out how strong the gifted Jian Chen would be
The object of life is an extremely expensive item on the Tianyuan continent, which cannot be possessed by ordinary people at all	', 'When Jian Chen placed his hand on the Saint Rock, De Shu extended his own arm to activate the Saint Rock through seemingly magical means
Found that the dust saw the eyes of the space ring in his hand to see, Uncle smiled, almost everybody saw him from the space ring out of the test of the Holy Spirit's power, will steal To such an eye, for this kind of gaze, Uncle T has no idea how many times I have seen it	', 'Immediately, Jian Chen could only feel an odd type of energy pulse from the stone and into his arm
"The four young masters, please put a hand on this sacred stone	 While the energy felt odd to him, it entered his body quite gently where it slowly circulated around before pulsing back out from his body and into the stone
" De Shu said with a smile	', 'De Shu stared at the Saint Rock for any change in color, but after a short period of time, there was no change at all
Sacred Stone is a special stone that can test the strength and properties of the Holy Spirit in every human body	 Not even a single shade of color other than its original one could be seen
It is widely spread on the Tianyuan Continent	', '“How is this possible, the Saint Rock doesn’t even have a sliver of color reflected!” De Shu couldn’t help but cry out in alarm
It is the only prop that tests individual strength	 The smile that had been on his face slowly disappeared from his face and turned to look at Jian Chen’s own face with an odd expression
The result of the Sacred Stone Test is replaced by the color of light	 Neither of the two could believe what was going on
, respectively, red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple	', 'Taking note of the look of shock on De Shu’s face and the still white Saint Rock, everyone subconsciously came to a realization
Among them, red is the division of the following powers of the Holy One	 Their faces couldn’t help but slowly change as they looked at their neighbors, then back at the front
Orange stands for the Holy One	 Blinking once, the look of abject bewilderment was noticeable on most people’s face while some people even sighed with looks of pity
Yellow is the power for the Holy One	', 'Changyang Ba’s face grew ugly while even Bi Yuntian’s face drained of color
Thus, the Blue is the Holy Master, and the Purple is the Holy Master of the Sky	 Neither of the two looked as if they were refusing to believe the news
As for the Sky Holy Master or above The Holy King, the Holy Emperor, and the strongest of the Holy Divines, their strength is not what the Holy Stone can test	', 'De Shu gave a gulp, this result was unbelievable to even him
Wen Yan said, Jian Chen retracted his gaze and reached out and placed a hand on the white stone called "Sacred Stone	 Immediately starting up the Saint Rock again, he had hoped that it was a mistake the first time
"At this moment, the eyes of all the people in the hall are on the white sacred stone	 But alas, the tree had bore no fruit, and the rock no color
Everyone can't help but look forward to it	', 'Again, this result was inconceivable to De Shu
They don’t know how talented the sword dust was when they were young	 The fourth master had been called a gifted genius since he was born, but it had seemed as if he was nothing more than a cripple who couldn’t cultivate or use Saint Force at all
When the sword dust's hand was placed on the sacred stone, Uncle also gave birth to a sacred stone that was placed on the sacred stone by a special method	', 'De Shu couldn’t help but give a disappointed sigh as he looked at the silent Jian Chen with a complicated look
Suddenly, the sword dust only feels a kind of weird energy rushing out of the sacred stone, and enters into the body along its own arm	 He turned around to face Changyang Ba, “Clan leader, the results are in
This bizarre energy is very gentle	 The Fourth master is unable to cultivate the Saint Force in any way
After walking around in one's own body, it is re-aligned	”', 'Upon hearing this declaration, Bi Yuntian’s face grew even more pale to the point that it was almost devoid of color
His own arm returns to Sacred Stone	 Looking at Jian Chen dumbfounded, she muttered, “That’s…that’s…not possible…how can Xiang’er…be a cripple…?” Right as she finished, her eyes rolled to the back of her head and crumpled down to the ground from her chair
The uncle's old eyes closely watched the change of the sacred stone, but after a moment, the sacred stone is still the original appearance, and no slightest change has taken place	 For her son that was widely regarded as a genius to suddenly be found as a cripple, she couldn’t handle this shocking news at all
"How could it be that the sacred stone was not reflected in the slightest	 No mother in the continent would be able to, let alone a member of a very prestigious clan
" Uncle Texuke could not help but whispered in a low voice	', 'As everyone that had gathered around heard the results, they all gasped and looked at Jian Chen with pity and disappointment
The look of smile on his face gradually disappeared and became dignified	 Jian Chen’s aunts Yu Feng Yan and Ling Long on the other hand, let loose a breath of air
Looking at Jian Chen's eyes, he looked very bizarre, faintly unbelievable	 Seeing the mother and son’s unfortunate situation, the two aunts couldn’t help but rejoice silently to themselves
I noticed the expression on the face of Uncle T	', '“Ah, fourth sister…fourth sister, what’s wrong? Fourth sister, please wake up! Fourth Sister, please…please wake up!” Rushing to her side, Bai Yushuang anxiously tried to awaken the unconscious Bi Yuntian, but to no avail
and the sacred stone that did not move in the slightest	', 'Hearing Bai Yushuang’s frantic yells, Changyang Ba immediately bounded over to Bi Yuntian and began to cry out, “Shuang Er, bring Yun Er to her bed!”', 'Even Jian Chen had rushed to his mother’s side without paying attention to anyone else
The people in the hall seemed to realize something	 His right hand was already pressed against his mother’s wrist to check for her pulse
The face could not help but slightly change	 It took a few precious seconds, but he had eventually confirmed that his mother was in no immediate danger
You look at me, I look at you, everyone's eyes, With a look of uncertainty, some more people sighed with a hint of regret	', 'Jian Chen looked at his disappointed father amongst the crowd, and even he had felt helpless secretly
Chang Yang Pa's face gradually became ugly, and Pik Wan-day, his face was a little pale, his face could not believe the look	 With a small sigh, he followed Bai Yushuang who was carrying his mother out of the hall
Uncle Drew took a deep breath	', '“Ai…” Watching Jian Chen leave, Changyang Ba’s face clearly had a look of extreme disappointment
He felt unbelievable for this result	 He had placed high hopes on Jian Chen before, but as the expectations were very high, so was the later disappointment
Then he started the appreciation again	 With this result in the end, his fourth son Xiang Tian was merely a cripple
However, the result was still true	', '“Clan head, don’t pay too much attention to this
Shengshi did not react in the slightest	 Although the fourth master cannot cultivate Saint Force, it doesn’t mean he isn’t a genius in other aspects or fields
For this result, Uncle T	” A young male clan member tried to console him
also felt unbelievable	', 'Changyang Ba waved his hand and said sadly, “Let’s not mention this topic anymore
Since childhood, he was known as the four masters of genius	 Everyone is dismissed
He was actually a non-cultivable person	” Finishing his sentence, Changyang Ba stood up to leave the hall
Uncle D was very disappointed and sighed	 Although he had acknowledged the fact that Jian Chen could be a genius in the other fields as said earlier, but Saint Force was the most important factor in this world, after all, strength is what mattered in the end
He looked at the sword dust of a very calm complexion and turned to face Chang Yang Pa	', 'The fact that the fourth son of the leader of the Changyang clan was a cripple spread throughout the Changyang mansion like wildfire
Then he said, “The family leader, after testing, has already determined that the four young masters cannot simply practice Sanli	 Some people regarded this new piece of information with joy while others were grievous
”Upon hearing this announcement, Pik Wan-tian's face had turned pale and no trace of blood	 One thing was sure however; Xiang’er’s status in the clan would rapidly drop after this affair
He stared blankly at the sword dust and murmured: “Impossible, impossible, how could Xiang’s be a waste person?	', 'In a wide spacious room, Jian Chen sat quietly by the bedside
” After muttering for himself a few times, Pik Wan-tian only felt dizzy	 His tranquil face was dipped downwards and what he was thinking about was unknown to everyone else
At the end of the day, he fell to the chair and fainted	 His mother Bi Yuntian still hadn’t woke up, her eyes were still shut as she laid in bed
It was actually a waste for a son who had always been known as a genius	 Aside from Jian Chen and some servant girls, only his third aunt Bai Yushuang and his second sister Changyang Mingyue were in the room
This result is clearly unacceptable to her	', '\xa0\xa0', '', '']
No mother can accept such a thing, let alone a person who lives in a big family	
Hearing this result, everyone in the hall was helpless and sighed	
The look to Jian Chen’s eyes was full of regrets and disappointment	
The three aunts of Yu Jian’s aunt Yu Fengyan and the big aunt exquisitely couldn’t help each other	
With a sigh of relief, watching the eyes of Jian Chen and Pik Wan Tian Muzi filled with gloating	
"Ah, four sisters, four sisters, what happened to you, four sisters, you wake up, four sisters, four sisters, you wake up soon	
" At this time, Bai Yushuang sitting beside Pik Wan Tian found a coma past Pik Wan, Anxiously shouted	
Hearing the shouts of Bai Yushuang, Changyang Paton found the coma past Pik Wantian and sighed a little	
Changyang Pa waved and waved, "Cream, help Yun to go and rest	
"Jian Chen also quickly came to Pik Wan Tian	
In the absence of anyone’s attention, his right hand was gently pressing on Pik Wan’s wrist	
After testing the pulse of Pik Wan Tian, ​​Jian Chen had already confirmed the blue sky	
Yuntian does not have much problem	
Jian Chen looked at the people in the lobby and his disappointed father	
He felt very helpless and secretly sighed	
Then Jian Chen followed the white jade cream holding his mother out of the hall	
" But after Jian Chen left, Chang Yang Pa sighed heavily	
His face looked extremely disappointed	
He originally held very high expectations for his fourth son, Jian Ding, but he didn't expect much	
The disappointment was even greater, but in the end it was actually the result	
His fourth son, Chang Xiangxiang, was actually an unmanageable waste	
"Homeowner, you don't care too much about it	
Although the four young masters can't cultivate, they may also have very outstanding talents in other respects," comforted a middle-aged man sitting down	
Chang Yang Pa waved and waved, "Of course, we don't mention this matter again	
Everybody is going to disperse it	
" Once the words were finished, Changyang tyrants got up and left here	
Although he knew in his heart that his fourth son might still have outstanding talents in other aspects, the most important thing in the world is still force	
After all, force is the foundation of everything	
Changyang Prefecture's four sons, Changyang Xiangtian, was a practice of repairing waste	
It quickly spread to every corner of Changyang's government	
For this matter, some people rejoiced that someone was sad, but to be sure, from then on, Changyang Xiangtian The status of Changyang Fuchu is sure to drop rapidly	
In a large room, Jian Chen quietly sat on the edge of the bed, calming his face and low head	
He didn't know what to think, and his mother, Pik Wan-day, still didn't wake up	
Lying in bed	
In addition to Jian Chen and his mother and several gimmicks, his three aunt Bai Yushuang and his second sister Chang Yang Mingyue are also in the room	
Chapter VIII Mishap Looking at the dust in the swordless head, Changyang’s bright eyes widened and he walked to the side of Jian Chen	['', '\xa0\xa0', 'Chapter 8: Disaster', 'Looking at the mute Jian Chen, Changyang Mingyue blinked a few times
He said, “Four younger brothers, you shouldn’t be too sad	 She walked up to Jian Chen’s shoulder and said, “Fourth brother, please don’t feel too sad
Someone will bully you later and you will tell your sister and sister	 If anyone in the future bullies you, tell your older sister and I’ll beat them up
You will be greeted with a meal for you	” Changyang Mingyue thought that Jian Chen was feeling sad because he was a cripple and that he didn’t have the ability to defend himself from anyone that would mock him
" Changyang Mingyue thinks that because of his inability to cultivate the Holy Power, the sword dust is only sad	', 'Hearing what Ming Yue had said, Jian Chen couldn’t help but lift his head to smile at Changyang Mingyue, “Don’t worry second sister, I won’t be an easy person to bully
After listening to these words, Jian Chen’s face could not help but smile and he looked up at the bright moon in Changyang	”', 'Only Jian Chen understood that it wasn’t because he was unable to cultivate Saint Force, it was due to the fact that he had been incorporating the Saint Force into the cells of his body
He said, “Be assured, my sister, I'm not so bullied	 Because of this, his body was essentially an empty shell, with no Saint Force remaining in his body
”Only the sword dust itself understands that he is not unable to cultivate the Holy Power here, but that he has absorbed all absorbed Holy Power into the flesh for the purpose of refining his body, so that his body is still empty	 If he hadn’t used this method, then today’s Saint Test would have had a different result
There is no point in Dantian	', 'It was unfortunate that Jian Chen wouldn’t be able to explain this situation to people
The power of St	 Even if he wanted to, he wouldn’t be able to explain how he came about this method
, otherwise, today's test results will definitely not be the case	 Not to mention that if he were to talk about Azulet Sword Law, then Jian Chen feared that the the history of both the technique and himself would become a great problem
It is a pity that these conditions can no longer be spoken out	', 'Although Jian Chen had understood that because of this situation, his status within the clan had taken a major hit
Once it is said, he will not be able to explain these things at all	 He didn’t care at all for that however and had secretly wanted a situation like this to happen
Regarding the purple sword, he will not say anything in any case	 If things had progressed as well as they did just now, then in the future he would be able to leave the Changyang mansion with more ease
Otherwise, I am afraid that The origin of law will become a big problem	 If he had still been stuck with the label of a genius, then departing from the mansion would not be as easy
Although Jian Chen understands that because of this incident, he will certainly greatly reduce his position in the Changyang Mansion, but he does not care much about it, and he still has a little expectation that such a situation will occur	 At the very least, as long as he didn’t have their approval, they would ignore his trips in and out of the mansion
Once things really develop into this, then he will later	', '“Xiang’er…Xiang’er…” A voice came calling out from the bed, Jian Chen’s mother had finally awakened
It is no doubt easier to leave Changyang	', 'Right after hearing his mother call his name, Jian Chen’s mind was jolted back to consciousness
If they are really put on a genius title, I am afraid that if they want to leave Changyangfu to go outside, it will not be easy	 He immediately turned around to look at her, “Mother, your son is here, everything is fine now
At least, before their own strength is not recognized by them, they will never let themselves go	”', 'Bi Yuntian had a complicated look on her face as she gasped, “Your mother is fine, but Xiang’er…ai…
Xiang Er	” As she spoke, a myriad of expressions were shown on her face ranging from sorrow, sadness, and even pain
" Softly called from the bed, this time, the mother of Jian Chen finally woke up	', '“Fourth sister, please don’t trouble yourself too much
As soon as I heard the voice, the spirit of Jian Chen stirred and immediately turned around and came to Pik Wan Tin	 Xiang Tian has been highly intelligent since birth, so although it is regretful that he cannot cultivate Saint Force, but in my opinion, Xiang Tian is not so simple
"Mom, baby is here, you're okay	 After all, no child in the clan is smarter than him
"Biyuntian looked at the sword dust with a complex look and sighed and said, "Your mother is all right, Xiang Er	” Bai Yu Shuan was trying to console the still grievous Bi Yuntian
" Pik Wantian's appearance as he wanted to speak, he looked at Jian Chen's eyes very complicated	', 'Bi Yuntian lifted her head slowly, “I had already understood this fact,
There is sadness, sadness, and a bit of pain	” Looking a Jian Chen, she gently started to caress the back of Jian Chen’s head
“Four sisters, you don’t bother too much	 “Xiang’er, don’t feel sad, what your second aunt said is correct
When Xiang Tian was young, he was extremely smart	 Although you cannot cultivate Saint Force, you are still a very intelligent child, we still don’t know in what areas you would be best suited for
Although it was a big pity that he couldn’t cultivate the Holy Power, in my opinion, Xiang Tian is not that simple	”', 'Jian Chen hesitated when he heard his mother speak, even though his mother was awake, he was not feeling all that much better
His future achievements still remain	 In reality, he had really wanted to tell the truth to the people there, his mother most definitely
There is no limit to it	 He wanted to say that he wasn’t a cripple that couldn’t cultivate Saint Force, but Jian Chen chose to endure this
After all, he has a clever mind that other children do not have	 “Mother, don’t worry, your son won’t disappoint you
” Bai Yushuang, who stood by the side of the bed, came to the bedside and said comfortingly	” Compared to his mother’s love for him, Jian Chen had utterly cherished it
Pik Wantian nodded slightly and said: "I also understand this truth	', 'He would later spend the whole day by the bedside of his mother before leaving at night
" With your eyes on Jian Chen, you have a white soft hand and gently stroked the head of the sword dust, softly said: "I don't have to use Xiang Er	 Periodically, Changyang Ba would drop in to see his wife but he would then leave just as quickly as he came
Sadly, your second aunt was right	 When it came to Jian Chen, Changyang Ba’s attitude towards him had been completely different these days in comparison to before
Although you can't cultivate Holy Power, but you have a bright mind, in other places, maybe there is a very good achievement	 With each passing time, Jian Chen could clearly see that Changyang Ba had been treating Jian Chen with a colder expression
"After listening to this, there was a hint of hesitation on Jian Chen’s face	', '', 'In the blink of an eye, four years had passed after Jian Chen’s Saint Test
When he looked at his mother, the sword dust was very uncomfortable	 During the days that he wasn’t busy, Jian Chen would shut himself in his room to continue training
At this moment, he really wanted to tell the truth of the matter to his mother	 The amount of training he needed nowadays was considerably longer than in the past; so much longer, that sometimes, Jian Chen would not be seen walking out of his room for the entire day
It is not impossible to cultivate the power of the Holy Spirit, but in the end the sword dust is still holding back, and said: "Lay, don't worry, the babe won't let you down	', 'In those four years, Jian Chen’s status in the clan had dropped immensely as expected
" For this hard-won motherhood, sword dust is very Treasure	 Changyang Ba had been treating him more coldly now, and no one had ever bothered to take the initiative to seek him out first
On this day, Jian Chen stayed with his mother in the room all day long and did not leave until the night	 It was vastly different than from his mother who saw him everyday, her love had never wavered at all
During this time, Chang Yang Pa came to visit Pik Wan Tian, ​​but soon left, and for Jian Chen, Chang Yang The performance of the tyrant today is very different from that of the past	', 'Early one day, Jian Chen slowly opened his eyes from his crossed-legged position once more to show that he had finished last nights training
His attitude toward the sword dust has gradually cooled down	 Immediately extending both arms palmside up, a light round ball gradually came into view
All this, the sword dust is in sight	 He flipped the beautiful ball into the air from his hands and watched it fall towards the ground where it came to a stop as both his hands were focused on it
In the twinkling of an eye, four years have passed since the test of sword dust power	', 'Hearing only the slightest of sounds, Jian Chen clapped his tiny hands together as if they were 2 steel plates and started to do pushups on the normally soft ground, occasionally bringing his head so close to the ground he could kiss it and even left an imprint on the ground afterwards
During this period, when the sword dust was all right, they all locked themselves in the room and practiced it	', 'Looking at his own hard work with a joyous smile, Jian Chen laughed
The cultivation time was even longer than before, sometimes even whole	 Half a year after the Saint Test, Jian Chen had already finished the cultivation stage of the first principle of the\xa0Azulet Sword Law
Days do not see sword dust out	 This meant that he officially started to cultivate the Saint Force without having to assimilate it into his own body
In this four-year period, the position of sword dust in Changyang Fuchu has indeed fallen a lot	 His cultivation rate was extremely fast, so fast that in the span of a just few years, he had already reached an astounding result
Even the Changyang tyrants have become cold to him	 As he was now, he could use the Saint Force that was stored inside of him to reinforce his hands so that they could break through stone without effort
In the past four years, he has never taken the initiative to look at him once	', 'Early in the morning, Jian Chen walked out of his room to wander around the Changyang Mansion alone
His mother, Pik Wantian, came to visit Jian Chen almost every day	 However, a group of patrolmen were walking around at the time spotted him, with each member having a different expression on their faces
Her love for Jian Chen did not change at all	 Some had a mocking look, while some looked at him with disdain, but very few looked at him with pity
Early the next morning, the sword dust sitting cross-legged on the bed slowly opened his eyes and ended his night's cultivation	 The fact that Jian Chen was a cultivation cripple had long ceased to be a secret within the clan, and so even the guards that patrolled the mansion had started to look at him differently
Then he only saw him with both hands and palms, and gradually appeared a white light, followed by sword dust	', 'But Jian Chen turned a blind eye towards them
A beautiful turn over from the bed, fell firmly on the ground, his hands at the same time plugging into the ground	 His stomach was growling from hunger, and so Jian Chen had decided with a small sigh that it was time to head towards the kitchens
Only a slight sound was heard	', 'It had been a long time since he had accompanied his mother to the dining halls to eat together
The small hands of the sword dust were as hard as two small steel plates	 Nowadays, he would go to the kitchens himself to eat breakfast, and would only eat lunch and dinner together with his mother and some of his aunts
They were easily on the floor with a very hard texture and only exposed the parts above the palm of the hand	', 'When Jian Chen reached the kitchens, over a hundred servants could be seen running about
Looking at his own masterpiece, Jian Chen’s face showed a glimmer of joy	 The kitchen was a tremendous mess due to the stove where it stood like a smoking hot steamer basket
As early as half a year after the end of the sword dust test, he put the basic cultivation practice of the first layer of Zijian Jiandian into practice	', '“Oh! Isn’t this the fourth master? The fourth master has come to the kitchens! Ai, this isn’t the proper place for someone as pampered as fourth master to be
Officially began to cultivate the power of the Holy Spirit	 The kitchens are for lowly servants like us, so why have you come here?” The teasing voice of a 20 year old servant came calling out
Because there is no need to use the absorbed Holy Power to practise it, the practice of sword dust is very fast	 Judging by his odd tone of voice, it was clear to tell that he was mocking Jian Chen
It took only a few years to achieve very great results	', 'Another voice continued straight after the first servant, “If my guess is correct, then fourth master came down to the kitchens to get some steamed buns
Nowadays, with the help of the Holy Spirit in the body, with its hands, sword dust can be inserted into ordinary stone slabs and it is also very easy	 But that’s weird, why isn’t the fourth master eating at the dining halls with the rest of the clan? Has he wronged himself and so wanted to eat the steamed buns from the kitchens? These steamed buns are only fit for us lowly servants and guards to eat however
In the early morning, Jian Chen walked out of the house door and walked alone in the Changyang Mansion	” Another 30 year old servant continued to sneer at Jian Chen
However, the guards in Fuchu’s patrol team looked at Jian Chen’s eyes full of weirdness, ridicule, disdain, regret, and sword dust	', 'Upon hearing the two people talk, the other servants in the kitchen all started to look at the spectacle
It is no longer a secret thing in Changyang Fuchu to practise wasteful people	 Both of these servants had the support of some of the superiors; for example, the 20 year old servant was not only introduced by Changyang Ba’s first wife Ling Long, but he was also the servant of Jian Chen’s eldest aunt
Now, even some patrolling guards in Changyang Prefecture have seen some changes in their eyes	 Rumors had it that Ling Long had hired him because he was a family relative, but because his body had lacked the power, he could only work in the kitchens
Jian Chen turned a blind eye to these things	', 'As for the 30 year old servant that spoke second, his brother is the group leader of the Changyang mansion guards
At this time, his stomach could not resist hunger and began to yell, and Jian Chen reached out and smeared his stomach and sighed in secret	', 'Hearing the two servants mock him, Jian Chen could only narrow his eyes slightly as anger flashed through his eyes
He immediately walked in the direction of the kitchen	 Biting back any sort of rebuke, he moved towards the giant steamer basket and held his hand out to take off the lid of it before all of a sudden, two giants hands came out of nowhere and quickly moved the steamer basket away from him
He had not been dining with his mother for a long time	', '“I should really bring these steamed buns to the guards right away, our honored guards haven’t yet eaten breakfast yet after all
He had gone to the kitchen every morning for breakfast	” Whisking away the basket, the servant muttered out loud as he exited from the kitchens, “What a crying shame, the fourth lady gave birth to a good for nothing cripple
Only at noon and in the evening he would go with his mother, Pik Wan Tien	”', 'At that last remark, Jian Chen went rigid
The dining hall dine with several aunts	 At last, the anger within his heart had finally broke free! Without saying a word, his legs blurred as both of his legs stamped across the ground
When the sword dust came to the kitchen, hundreds of folks were busy inside	 Reaching the servant with the steamer basket within a few seconds, he raised one fist and brought it down onto the servant’s back!', '“Bang!”', 'Completely caught off guard, the servant carrying the steamer basket was sent staggering to the ground
The kitchen was suffocating	 The basket he had carried dropped to the floor and with a great big smash, the nice and plump steamed buns scattered across the floor in four directions one by one
Because of the stove, it was like staying in a steaming steamer	', 'Everyone in the kitchen stared at this unforeseen event with a shocked look
"Oh, this is not the four masters, how did the four young masters come to our kitchen again? Well, this kitchen is the place where we are staying	 Seeing where Jian Chen now stood, no one could believe what they saw
How can you come to this kind of place with your delicate body of four young masters?" After seeing Jian Chen, a man in his twenties who was in his early 20s began to laugh	 No one had saw clearly how fast or even when Jian Chen had moved
The strange tone made anyone listen to the ridiculous words in his speech	 For the 7 year old fourth master to have brought down the 30 year old servant with a single punch to his knees, it was inconceivable
When this voice fell, one of the guys immediately contacted him and said, "If I guess right, the four young masters must be in the kitchen to get the girl's head, but it's strange that the four young masters did not go to the dining hall and the family	 Although the steamer basket had been dropped and the food wasted, everyone was still amazed by this show in front of them
Meals together, but we have to wrong ourselves	', '“Hahaha, Brother Qiu Er Lao, you really amaze me
We actually go to the kitchen to get the steamed buns	 Even though you are an expert that has reached the 3rd layer of Saint Force, yet you were knocked down by the fist of a little child! Did you waste too much energy with a girl last night to become this weak?” Looking at the servant at the ground, the first servant who had made fun of Jian Chen was now roaring with laughter at the second servant
This steamed bun can be eaten by our servants and Fuchu guardians	', 'The servant called Qiu Er crawled up from the ground, his eyes burning with fury towards Jian Chen as the words of his younger servant friend reached his ears
” It was about 30 years of age	 For a 7 year old child to push him down to the ground, especially a child that was a cripple in the ways of cultivation, this was the ultimate form of humiliation and shame for him
Young people, mockingly watching sword dust	 After all, although he had not yet condensed his Saint Force into a Saint Weapon, he was still a practitioner that had reached a level far above that of the cripple!', 'Shaking his head in rage, Qiu Er had forgotten in that moment that Jian Chen still held the status of being the fourth master
After listening to the two of them, the other guys in the kitchen looked at them with a good look	 With a snarl, he jumped towards where Jian Chen stood and sent a punch towards his stomach
Both of them had supporters behind them, and the man in his 20s was the big aunt of Jian Chen	', 'Watching Qiu Er’s fist get closer, Jian Chen had a look of disdain on his face
That is, Chang Yang Pa's first wife Delphi introduced, and I heard that the exquisite also touched the side of relatives, but because of their own little ability, so only work in the kitchen	 To him, this punch that he had thrown out was full of mistakes and openings, and so he dodged by moving to the side very slightly to avoid the fist
As for the 30-year-old young man who spoke later, his brother was the captain of Changyang Prefecture's guard	 Throwing himself forward, Jian Chen’s right leg arced in a beautiful way and kicked Qiu Er firmly on the nose
Listening to the ridiculous words of the two men, the swordsman's eyebrows wrinkled and his eyes flashed an anger, but eventually he was stifled by him and went straight to a huge steamer just as he was about to reach out and uncover the steamer	', '“Ah!”', 'Qiu Er let loose a blood curling scream as his clasped his bloody nose with his hands
When the lid was on, he didn't want to take a big step and grabbed the huge steamer to remove it	 Even then, a small steady flow of blood leaked through his hands
"The steamer's steamed buns have to be handed over to the security guards	 Jian Chen’s leg had not been merciful, Qiu Er’s nose had been kicked in and broke
The brothers who served as guards in the Changyang House haven't eaten breakfast yet	 The acute pain in his face had already drained it of color
" Then, the guy walked outside while holding a steamer	', '\xa0\xa0', '', '']
In the end he murmured: "What a pity ah, Mrs	
Four actually gave birth to a useless waste son	
"After listening to these words, the body of the sword dust was slightly stiff	
At this moment, the anger in his heart could not help but burst out	
He said nothing, and then his body shook slightly, and his feet lightly stepped on the ground, at an extremely fast speed	
Came behind the man holding the steamer and punched himself directly behind the guy	
"bump!"Unguardedly, the man holding the steamer was directly slammed into the ground by the fist of sword dust, and the steamer he held in his hand fell to the ground	
Suddenly, one by one	
The rolling gimmick fell out from the inside and slammed on the ground to roll around	
Sudden changes caused everyone in the kitchen to squint and look at the dust in a sudden change of position	
Everyone in the kitchen could not believe it	
They did not even see clearly how the sword dust ran	
To their disbelief, only the four young masters at the age of seven actually fell a fistful of a thirty-year-old adult on the ground	
Although the latter held a large steamer in his hands, the scene was in a group	
In the eyes of the buddy, I still feel incredible	
"Ha ha ha, Qiu two old brother, you too surprised me, so you are also a Holy Power to reach the three-tier master, was actually hit by a child's fist fell to the ground, you will not be in the woman last night There was a lot of effort on the stomach, and it was so weak	
" The fellow who looked down on the floor and laughed at Jian Chen, the young man in his late twenties, couldn't help laughing	
After listening to this, the man named Qiu Er was crawled up from the ground	
His eyes were full of anger and looked at the sword dust	
He was dropped on the ground by a seven-year-old child who was hit with a fist	
This child is still an incapacitated person who cannot practice the Holy Power	
This is a shameful disgrace to him	
After all, although he himself is not the Holy One who has consecrated the sacred soldier, he is also a person who has reached the third level of Holy Power	
The flames of anger fainted	
Now Qiu Er seems to have forgotten the identity of the four young masters of the Changyang government in the form of sword dust	
He roared quickly and quickly came to the front of the sword, directly hitting the fist of Jian Chen	
Looking at the fist of Qiu Erji, Jian Chen’s face showed a disdainful look	
The punch appeared to him to be full of flaws	
Immediately afterwards, the sword dust body slightly slanted, and moved a small step to the side, just to escape	
The fists hit by Qiu II then jumped and leapt	
The right leg quickly crossed a beautiful trajectory in the air, and Kou's kick was on Kiu's nose	
"what!"Qiu II made a scream of pig-like squeaking	
His hands immediately licked his nose, and there was blood running down between his fingers	
This sword dust did not leave his hand in the first place and he directly knocked Qiu’s nose bones off	
The severe pain has already made Qiu's face pale	
Chapter 9 Strength Exposure Qiu two eyes full of anger looked at the sword dust, that eyes want to be a fierce beast, as if to swallow the sword dust abruptly	['', '\xa0\xa0', 'Chapter 9: Revealed Strength', 'Qiu Er looked at Jian Chen with obvious anger in his eyes, making it seem as if he was a wild beast that wanted to take Jian Chen down
"You little bastard, today I must take a good lesson of you	', '“You little bastard, I’m going to teach you a lesson today!” Qiu Er roared angrily
" Qiu two snarled with anger, two steps out of sword dust, a quick kick, kicked directly to the head of sword dust, this one The kicking out of the leg is very fast	 He dashed towards Jian Chen and sent a kick towards his head
If you are really kicked, it will definitely hurt the average person	 The kick was fairly fast, and if it connected, it definitely would not result in a small wound for any normal person
If you kick in an ordinary child, it will definitely cause fatal injuries	 But since Jian Chen was still in the body of a child, a direct hit from such a strong kick had a high chance of killing him
Feeling the strength of Qiu Er's leg, the 20-year-old youth who had previously ridiculed the sword dust suddenly changed his face and became pale and yelled loudly: "Qiu Erge, stop!" It is also the four young masters of the Changyang government, and the children of the Changyang government’s family, although they are not considered by the family because they are incapable of practicing the power of the Holy Spirit, but after all their identity is there, laughing at a thing or two, but once they’re right The young masters of Changyang government began to be severely punished, and even if they were backed by two people, that would not change anything	', 'Assessing the strength of Qiu Er’s kick, the 20 year old servant’s face suddenly lost its humorous expression and became pale
Discovered the strength of Qiu Erji's leg, Jian Chen’s face changed slightly, his eyes flashed with a touch of Hanmang, then the slight side of the body, easily avoiding the kick of Qiu Yi’s second leg, and the Jianchen body was not repulsive	 Shouting out in alarm, he cried, “Brother Qiu Er, stop!” Jian Chen was still the fourth master as well as the son of Changyang Ba despite being a cripple, he still had some degree of respect around the Changyang Mansion
Into, quickly approaching the top of the hill two, with one arm stuck in the thighs of Qiu Erna yet to withdraw, the other hand lifted the thigh of the other leg of Qiu, and then sang down, sinking Forces, mobilize all the Holy Powers in the body, and finally with the weak body, abruptly lifted Qiu II's full body to give up	 It was barely okay to mock him, but to raise a hand against the fourth master was unforgivable
Holding Qiu Er's body, Jian Chen did not give Qiu II the time to resist	 Even if they had the support of any of the elders they would still incur a terrible punishment upon them
He stepped out on both feet and ran a few steps on the ground	', 'Seeing the intensity of Qiu Er’s kick, Jian Chen’s face changed as well
He threw out Qiu Er directly through the momentum of Qian Qiang	 His eyes grew cold as he leaned to the side again
Qiu's body flew about five meters away from the air and eventually fell to a large table dedicated to the vegetables	 Calmly staying outside the reach of Qiu Er’s kick, he didn’t retreat
Unexpectedly, the location of Qiu II fell, and there was a steel body underneath	 Instead Jian Chen rapidly approached Qiu Er’s body, he placed his arm on Qiu Er’s still outstretched thigh while the other hand went to the other thigh
Thorn, a strange tool like a hedgehog	 With a low growl, Jian Chen released all of the Saint Force he had stored in his body into his waist and surprisingly lifted the over a hundred pound Qiu Er above his tiny body
Qiu's body was just above the strange tool used in this kitchen	', 'Raising Qiu Er’s body, Jian Chen didn’t bother giving him time to retaliate, both his legs began to move across the ground as Jian Chen threw the heavy body of Qiu Er forward
The steel spine, which was more than one inch in length, pierced his body and suddenly, Qiu II once again made a pig-like scream	', 'Qiu Er’s body flew over 5 meters before slamming into a table meant for cutting vegetables
He suffered from severe, painful pain, and even his facial muscles were distorted	 Coincidentally, underneath his falling body was a stack of iron skewers, falling down onto that would make him resemble a bizarre human porcupine
All the guys in the kitchen got stank, and their eyes were full of incredibleness	', 'Qiu Er fell on top of the skewers, and at least an inch of skin had been pierced through by them
A seven-year-old boy could not only resist the weight of Qiu Er, but also had the power to hold three layers of Holy Power	 Immediately, Qiu Er screamed in pain as the skin of his body was distorted and the pain in his nose was still piercing through his mind
Qiu II was defeated	', 'Every servant in the kitchen suddenly came to a standstill from the unbelievable event they had just watched
If I say this out, I am afraid that no one in the Changyang Mansion will believe it	 A single 7 year old not only fought back against a heavyweight person like Qiu Er, but he even defeated that person, who had reached the 3rd layer of Saint Force
Jian Chen's eyes coldly watched the screaming of Qiu Er and another young man who mocked him	 If news of this got out, no one in the Changyang clan would be able to believe it
He said nothing	', 'Jian Chen looked at Qiu Er’s suffering with cold eyes while making a mocking face at him
He left the kitchen and even the girl did not take it	 He didn’t say anything, and decided to leave the kitchen instead, without taking even a single steamed bun with him
Came to the outside, Jian Chen secretly sighed, did not think that dignified Changyang House four young masters, even the people in the kitchen are beginning to bully him	', 'After exiting the kitchens, Jian Chen slowly exhaled
After leaving the feelings of depression in his heart behind him, Jian Chen walked casually in the Changyang Mansion with a small pace	 He didn’t think that even the servants in the kitchens would begin to mock the fourth master
Changyang House is very large	', 'Throwing away the depression from his heart, Jian Chen began to stroll around the Changyang Mansion once more
At least in the past few years, the sword dust has never been visited by Changyang House	 With the mansion being so vast, Jian Chen had never once seen the entirety of it
The scenery in Fuchu is also very good	 Even the scenery around the place was nice to look at, as gardens surrounded every inch of the outside yards
Everywhere there are pavilions and pavilions	 There were many lakes as well as flower gardens that had very rare specimens that could not be seen anywhere else and they carried a sweet fragrance
There are just a few small lakes	', 'As the fourth master of the Changyang clan, Jian Chen was free to wander wherever he wanted
In the garden, there are a lot of exotic flowers and plants, floating in faint scent	 As he wandered to and fro, he would come across important roadways and buildings that had many experts concealed everywhere
As the four young masters of Changyang House, sword dust can wander around Changyang Palace	 When he saw those experts however, he had decided to think no more about it; after all, he knew that the Changyang clan is one of the four great clans of Lore City
Along the way, sword dust finds itself in some of the important roads and buildings in Fuchu	 Lore City was was a First Class City, so the title of being a big clan was a prestigious one
There are people with weak skills hiding inside	', 'As he walked, he had unconsciously came to the middle of a calm flower garden
For these swords, The dust was no longer strange	 Jian Chen had not noticed that his third brother Changyang Ke had been carrying a wooden axe as he trained within the same flower garden
After all, he also understood that in the past few years, Changyang House was one of the four major families in Lohr City, and it had a very high status in the first-tier city of Lohr City	 However, in the eyes of a battle hardened Jian Chen, it looked as if Changyang Ke was just recklessly swinging the axe around with no particular style in mind at all
As I walked along, I realized that the sword dust had come to a beautiful garden	', 'Although Jian Chen had studied the way of the sword in the past world, he had studied many different axe wielding experts and how they fought
In an empty space, sword dust actually found that my third brother Chang Yangke was holding a wooden axe in his hands	 So even Jian Chen was familiar with how one should use an axe, but the way Changyang Ke was handling it, Jian Chen was speechless
Martial arts, but the appearance of Changyangke's wielding an axe, in the eyes of the swordsman's swordsman, is as if he was slashing in a random manner, without any slightest moves	 How could this be considered training?', 'Just as Jian Chen was about to turn around to leave, Changyang Ke noticed him out of the corner of his eye
Although sword dust is well-crafted for kendo, but in the past there were many masters who used axe and all kinds of weapons	 Slowly ceasing his movements, Changyang Ke’s face started to show signs of ill intent as he smiled
Therefore, for all kinds of weapons, the sword dust is also slightly familiar with the two, and Chang Yang grams this random mess The chopping action makes the sword dust feel quite silent	', '“Fourth brother, come on over, your third brother has some candy for you to eat
This is where the practice of martial arts is	” Changyang Ke cried out to Jian Chen
Just as the sword dust was about to turn and leave, Chang Yangke suddenly found Jian Chen, and the action in his hand stopped immediately	', 'Hearing Changyang Ke’s words, Jian Chen nearly tripped down onto the ground in disbelief
His face also showed a grin	 Secretly thinking to himself, he thought, “Even a 7 year old wouldn’t fall for such a line
“Four younger brothers, come over, and the third brother will give you sugar	” However, Jian had forgot to account for that aside from the experiences of his past world, he was still no better than a 7 year old child
” Chang Yangke looked at Jian Chen and shouted at him	', 'But he paid no mind to the words of Changyang Ke and continued to keep on walking without even turning his head back
After listening to Chang Yangke's sentence, Jian Dust was almost a bear to the ground and secretly thought: "This sentence is taken to abduct a three-year-old child is still about the same	', 'Seeing that Jian Chen was getting farther and farther away, Changyang Ke began to get angry
" However, the sword dust does not seem to realize if it is thrown The experience of opening a past life is not much bigger than a three-year-old child	 Throwing the wooden axe in his hands to the ground, he dashed towards Jian Chen and eventually caught up to him
For Chang Yangke, the sword dust didn't bother, and he kept walking and heading away	', '“Fourth brother, did you not hear me just now?” Changyang Ke blocked Jian Chen’s path like a cork in a bottle, his face red with anger as he stared at Jian Chen
See Jian Chen dust goes farther and farther, Chang Yangke's face reveals a hint of anger, throw away the wooden axe in his hand, then immediately chase up and put down the sword dust	', '“Is something wrong?” \xa0Jian Chen looked at Changyang Ke with a calm gaze while implying a hint of coldness in his question
"Four younger brothers, did you not hear me just when I told you?" Chang Yangke stopped in front of the sword dust, said the cymbal, and said angrily	 Jian Chen did not harbor any good sentiments towards his third brother
"Is there something?" Looking calmly at Chang Yangke, the tone of the sword dust asked lightly, and the tone was a bit indifferent	 In the past two years, Changyang Ke would always look for some way to bully Jian Chen, \xa0and ever since the news of Jian Chen being a cripple, his actions became much more severe
For himself, the third brother, the sword dust did not have a good impression	 If it wasn’t for the fact that Jian Chen rarely went outside, the amount of times Changyang Ke bullied Jian Chen would have been increased tenfold
In these two years, Chang Yangke always tried to bully the sword dust, and Chang Yangke was after the sword dust was unable to cultivate the Holy Power	 However, every time he had tried to bully Jian Chen, it would always result in failure and sometimes Jian Chen would also find a way to bully him back
The practice is becoming more and more excessive	 This had created a sense of resentment within Changyang Ke’s heart which made him seek revenge even more
If the sword dust is not going out, I am afraid that the number of sword battles in Changyang will only be more	', '“Fourth brother, come accompany your third brother in practicing some martial arts
However, Chang Yangke did not succeed only once	” While talking, Changyang Ke had already started dragging Jian Chen towards the place where he practiced and did not give Jian Chen a chance to respond
In the dark he was bullied by Jian Chen	 Changyang Ke was actually very excited at the moment, for although he was not a match for Jian Chen when comparing their intelligence, he did not think he would be weaker than Jian Chen in terms of strength
Many times, this has caused Chang Yangke to remain skeptical, always looking for an opportunity to revenge	 After all, his fourth brother was a cripple in terms of martial cultivation and could not even cultivate any Saint Force, in Changyang Ke’s mind, this was the perfect opportunity to exact his revenge
"Three younger brothers, accompany your third brother to practice martial arts together	', 'Not long after Jian Chen had been forcefully dragged by Changyang Ke to where he was practicing his martial arts, Changyang Ke picked up the wooden axe he had thrown to the side earlier and then said to Jian Chen, “Third Brother, are you ready? I am going to start attacking now
" Then, Changyang grams ranging from sword dust agreed, to pull the arm of sword dust to go to the place where he had martial arts forced to pull	”', 'Seeing Changyang Ke’s gentle smile, Jian Chen let a hint of playfulness appear within his eyes
In his heart, Chang Yangke was excited and he couldn't fight his intelligence but he could not believe that he was not an opponent of Jian Chen in the use of force	 Holding both of his palms in a clueless manner, he asked, “Third Brother, you have a weapon in your hands, don’t tell me you want me to fight against you barehanded?”', 'Hearing his brother talk, Changyang Ke looked distracted for a second
After all, he was a martial artist who was simply impossible	 Looking at the wooden axe in his own hands, he hesitated only for a second before tossing it towards Jian Chen, as he said, “Then I shall give you the axe fourth brother, and I will be the one that will fight bare handed
The cultivation of the Holy Power, so in his view this non-condensing is a good opportunity to bully the sword dust	” Although the axe was wooden, it was still 10 pounds
Soon, sword dust was forced by Changyang Ke to the place where he had practiced martial arts before	 Even for a 10 year old child, swinging this around would prove to be difficult
Chang Yangke picked up the wooden axe he had thrown aside from the ground and looked at Jian Chen with a bad smile	 Changyang Ke had thought of this and threw it towards Jian Chen for this reason
Fourth brother, are you ready? The third brother will start attacking	 He wanted to make Jian Chen humiliate himself while he would look like the gracious one
"Looking at the feminine smile on Chang Yangke's face, the sword dust showed a playful look in his eyes	', 'Jian Chen took the wooden axe in front of him and started to inspect it
He spread his hands and said, “Three brothers, but you have weapons in your hands	 The axe was very crudely made, only the shape of the axe was there, while the blade of it was almost non existent
Can you let me free to fight with you? ”After listening to this, Changyang Ke took a sip and looked at the wooden axe he was holding in his hand	 Even if he were to try to chop at a person, it would not cause significant harm
He slightly hesitated	 At the very most, the axe would only leave behind a sore bruise
Then he tossed his hand and tossed the axe to Jian Chen	', 'Seeing Jian Chen hold up the 10 pound axe with ease, Changyang Ke’s eyes revealed a trace of shock
With the axe, the third brother will fight with you empty handed	 He had not been expecting this change of events
” Although the axe is wooden, but its weight also has ten jins, an ordinary child less than ten years old, in order to mention it is really difficult, Changyangke It was precisely this point that he tossed the axe to Jian Chen and sincerely wanted to see him ugly	', 'Jian Chen looked at Changyang Ke and gave a faint laugh, “Third brother, perhaps you should use this axe instead
The sword dust reached over to the wooden axe and looked in his hand	” Right as he spoke, he tossed the axe back at Changyang Ke
The work of the axe was very rough	', 'Catching the axe he had only just thrown at Jian Chen, Changyang Ke began to feel suspicious, “Fourth brother, could it be you still wanted to fight me bare handed?”', 'Jian Chen began to laugh as he shook his head
There was only one shape of an axe, and the axe blade had no open front	 Grabbing a nearby tree, he snapped off a branch one meter long
Even if it was cut down, it would not cause Injury, at most, is a bit painful	 Shaving away the little twigs and leaves, Jian Chen was left with only a single branch
See Jian dust easily with the help of a heavy axe ten jins, Chang Yang Ke eyes exposed a hint of surprise, this situation beyond his expectations	', '“This will be my weapon!” Raising the branch, Jian Chen laughed gently
Jian Chen looked to Changyangke, his face showing a hint of faint smile, said: "The third brother, this axe or you to use it	', 'Changyang Ke looked at the tiny stick that could be quickly turned into chopsticks in Jian Chen’s hand and laughed
" Then, the sword dust thrown an axe to Changyang grams	 He was no longer angry as the day that he would be able to beat Jian Chen with ease seemed to be getting closer and closer
In one hand, he caught the axe thrown by the sword dust	 The dream of being able to bully Jian Chen without taking any losses had finally come for Changyang Ke
Chang Yangke asked doubtfully: "Four younger brothers, if you don't use weapons, you want to fight with me	 This would make him extremely happy
"Jian Chen grinned and shook his head, then came to a small tree, broken a branch of about a meter long, all the leaves above to remove, leaving only a bare branch back to its original position	', 'Changyang Ke clasped onto the axe firmly, “Then fourth brother, you’d best be careful
"This is my weapon!" Yang raised the branch in his hands, and Jian Xiao said lightly	 Your third brother will begin to attack!” Right after saying it, Changyang Ke immediately stormed towards Jian Chen with the axe held in both his hands before trying to bring it down onto Jian Chen
Chang Yangke's eyes glanced over the small branch of chopsticks in the hands of the sword dust	', 'This axe wasn’t able to inflict a fatal wound, so Changyang Ke didn’t bother to hold back and swung with all his might
Not only was he not angry, but he showed a happy smile	', 'Jian Chen’s legs crossed forward each other as he dodged the axe
In his opinion, defeating the sword dust today is getting easier and easier	 Swinging his tree branch with frightening speed, the branch had suddenly became more frightening in power
The bully, a younger brother who had suffered a lot of losses, was excited by Chang Yangke	 Even Jian Chen’s demeanor had changed abruptly, as he pressed forward, the normally safe branch became a deadly sword in his hands
Chang Yangke slowly grasped the axe and said: "Four brothers, then you are careful, the third brother attacked Oh	', 'Jian Chen was swinging the sword with unbelievable speed, leaving Changyang Ke with almost no room to counter when at last, the tree branch had already placed itself on Changyang Ke’s throat
" Then, Changyang Ke body immediately rushed forward, ran to the front of the sword dust, his hands tightly hold The axe was slashed toward the sword dust	', '“Third brother, you’ve lost!” With a playful banter, he returned the axe that Changyang Ke had dropped shortly in the middle of the match
This wooden axe was not cut off at all, so Chang Yangke did not leave his hand in the slightest, and he was very heavy	', 'Changyang Ke could only stare at the tree branch at his neck with disbelief flashing across his eyes
The sword dust stepped in a staggered way, easily escaped Changyangke's axe, and then quickly pierced the branches of his hands	 He had not seen the tree branch move at all, by the time his eyes had saw a sign of movement, the match had already finished
Just as the branches pierced, the momentum of the sword dust suddenly changed, resembling a sword-like sharpness	', 'Still in shock, Changyang Ke shook his head
The branch that was pierced in the hand, with even more impetuous momentum, at this moment, this ordinary branch in the hands of sword dust, seems to have turned into a real sword	 Grabbing the tree branch at his throat, he snapped it in two and cried out in disbelief, “That didn’t count
The branches in the hands of the sword dust pierced at a very rapid rate	 It definitely didn’t count! Fourth brother, you weren’t fighting fair at all
Chang Yangke did not realize it at all and the branches had already stopped in front of Changyangke's throat	”', 'Jian Chen laughed as he looked at the red faced Changyang Ke
"Three brothers, you lost!" Looking at the playful look of Changyangke, who has yet to recover the axe, Jianfen said softly	 “Third brother, you don’t even know if I was fighting fair or not
Changyak stared blankly at the branches of his throat in front of his throat	” He said in a strange voice
He couldn't believe what he looked like	', '“That…that is…” Changyang Ke scratched at his cheek and stammered as he tried to think of an excuse
He didn't even see how the branch was pierced	 In the end, he still couldn’t accept the result and said, “Either way, that match just now didn’t count
He just felt that it was a flower	 Let’s fight one more time!”', 'Jian Chen gathered the pieces of the tree branch that Changyang Ke had snapped with a laugh, “Okay, let us fight one more time then
The branch has already appeared in front of its throat	” Without further ado, he walked 5 meters away from Changyang Ke
After staying for a long time, Chang Yangke suddenly regained consciousness, reached out and folded the branch that had stopped in front of his throat into two sections, and shouted in disgruntled voice: “Not counting, this isn’t counting, four younger brothers, You shamelessly	', '\xa0\xa0', '', '']
"Jian Chen looked funny and looked at his slightly flushed Chang Yangke	
He said in a weird tone: "Third brother, I don't know where I am jealous	
" After listening to this, Chang Yangke scratched his head, shriveled, and he couldn't say anything	
Finally he snorted, and said: "Anyway, just that time, it's not counted	
We'll come back again	
"Jian Chen organized the next branch that was broken by Changyangke and said with a chuckle: "Well, we'll come back again	
" Then, the sword dust slowly receded to five meters	
Chapter Ten Weight Chang Yangke held the axe tightly with both hands and looked at the sword dust with vigilance	['', '\xa0\xa0', 'Chapter 10: High Regards', 'Both of Changyang Ke’s hands clenched his axe tightly, as he attentively looked at Jian Chen
Because of the lesson he had just learned, he no longer dared to underestimate the sword dust, so this particular caution	 Thanks to the lesson he had just learned, he wouldn’t dare to underestimate Jian Chen a second time, so in this round, Changyang Ke moved around carefully
Jian Chen's face is always hung with a faint smile, and see Changyang Ke's eyes still carry a kind of play that Chang Yang Ke can not understand, said: "The third brother, you can start the attack yet?"Chang Yang tightened the axe in his hands	', 'Jian Chen began to laugh at Changyang Ke, causing him to scowl in confusion, “Third brother, can we start sparring now?”', 'Changyang Ke tightly gripped his axe; this time, he used his Saint Force to help him
This time, he mobilized the Holy Power in his body and immediately rushed toward the sword dust again, which was obviously faster than before	 Once again he charged at Jian Chen, but this time he was much faster
The sword dust waved his hand freely to the branch that had only half a meter in length, and suddenly he gave birth to a wonderful feeling, as if his own god had a very intimate connection with the branch, and at the same time in the sword dust	', 'Jian Chen casually waved around the less than half a meter long tree branch in his hands
In his brain, he could not help but realize the supernatural powers of God’s Imperial Sword that he realized in his previous life when he was about to die	 He was feeling fantastic for some odd reason; it was almost as if the branch had some sort of secret connection with himself
Finally, under the control of his “God”, the sword in his hand leaped over 100 meters to pierce the scene of Tokgo to defeat the throat	 At the same time, within Jian Chen’s heart, he couldn’t help but feel the same sensation he had in the previous world when he had been on the verge of death, where he could understand the amazing power of the Realm of the Sword God
Thought of this, the sword dust thoughts move, the meaning of the control of the branches of the hand toward Changyang grams to go	 During that moment, he had finally been able to control his sword with his “Spirit”, and had sent it flying 100 meters straight through Dugu Qiubai’s throat
"Oh!"As soon as the thoughts began, the branches held in the hands of the sword dust seemed to be alive	 ', 'Thinking of that moment, Jian Chen sprung into action, as the tree branch in his hand was sent flying towards Changyang Ke
They autonomously flew out of the hands of the sword dust, and thundered toward Changyangke at an extremely fast speed, and the whole branch was faintly covered with a faint white light	', '“Whoosh!”', 'Bending to Jian Chen’s will, the tree branch looked as if it was alive, and flew from his hands
With a strong and full of sharp air, Jian Qi was born out of it	 Flying at incredible speeds towards Changyang Ke, the tree branch was enveloped by a faint white glow of light
The speed of the branches was very fast	 A strong yet acute amount of Sword Qi was emitted from the tree branch, making it look like a bolt of lightning
It was as lightning-fast and I saw a flash of light and I had already arrived at Changyangke's chest	 With a brilliant flash of light, the branch had already reached Changyang Ke’s stomach
Feeling the speed of the tree's flight and the sturdy air on the branch where he did not know where to come from, the sword dust was shocked and immediately stopped the tree branches	 ', 'Immediately realizing the trajectory path, as well as the amount of Sword Qi on the tree branch, Jian Chen turned pale with fright
The speed of the sticking out of the branch and the sudden appearance of Jian Qi on the branch, He had no doubt that this branch of bamboo could easily pierce Chang Yangke's body	 He frantically tried to stop the branch from reaching its destination
Even if he couldn't die, he would suffer serious injuries	 If the tree branch was not stopped, then it would have, without a doubt, pierced through Changyang Ke and kill him
Once this kind of consequence was created, the sword and dust would be in jeopardy	 Even if he wasn’t immediately killed, Changyang Ke would still have suffered from a fatal wound, which would lead to a disaster for Jian Chen
The branch had finally stopped when he reached Changyok's chest	', 'Right as the branch reached Changyang Ke’s stomach, it began to slow, but not before piercing into his stomach just by a small amount
Despite this, the front of the branch also pierced Chang Yangke's chest	 Looking closer, the tree branch had merely penetrated through the skin, but if Jian Chen had been a tiniest bit slower with his command for it to stop, then Changyang Ke would had been left with the branch straight through his body
However, it was good that the penetration was not deep, but only pierced the skin	 Such a thought was too horrible for Jian Chen to imagine
If the sword dust reacts more slowly, the body of Chang Yangke will be pierced by this branch, and the consequences will be unthinkable	 ', 'Wiping away the sweat on his forehead, Jian Chen noticed that there was still a thin line of his soul connected to the tree branch
Jian Chen wiped the cold sweat on his forehead	 Confirming once more with his soul that the branch had only pierced Changyang Ke’s skin, Jian Chen let out a sigh of relief
His gods and branches had a very intimate connection	', 'Feeling the slight pain from his stomach, the somewhat plump Changyang Ke couldn’t help but start to pale
Through the induction of the branches, the dust in the sword understood that the branches just pierced the skin of Chang Yangke	 When he looked down and saw the bloodstains on his stomach, his face changed drastically
There was nothing wrong with this	 A wail was heard as he started to cry, with teardrops falling in a never ending stream down his cheeks as if his eyes were fountains
Make the sword dust a lot of relaxation	blood…I’m bleeding! Waaah, fourth brother, you…you hit me! Waaaah, Mo…Mother, I’m going to tell my mother about this
The severe pain from the chest caused Chang Yangke's cheeky little face to go blank	fourth brother hit me…!” Changyang Ke immediately transformed into a child who only knew how to cry
When he looked down and saw the blood on his chest, his face suddenly changed, and he immediately burst into tears	 Throwing down his wooden axe, he fled from the garden, bawling nonstop
The tears in the eyes flowed like fountains	 Changyang Ke was barely 10 years old after all, he had not yet matured enough to withstand an ordeal like this
Bleeding, Wow	', 'Looking at the slowly fading away Changyang Ke, Jian Chen couldn’t help but shake his head
Four younger brother	 As he walked out from the gardens by himself, he felt a small bit of fear in his heart
You beat me, oh	 What type of strict punishment would he receive for this?', '……
I'm going to tell my mother to go	', '“What? Chang Bai, are you playing a joke on me?” In a study room, the leader of the Changyang clan, Changyang Ba stood up from his chair in surprise
Four brothers beat me	 Focusing his attention on the elder in front of him, Changyang Ba couldn’t help but be amazed by what he had just heard
” At this moment, Chang Yangke seems to have become a naughty child who is crying, throwing away the wooden axe in his hands and cries out to the garden	 ', 'The elder that stood in front of Chanygang Ba was the housekeeper of the Changyang Clan, Chang Bai
After all, Chang Yangke is just a child who is still under ten years old and still grows in a greenhouse	', 'Chang Bai nodded his head solemnly, “My lord, even I didn’t believe this matter at first, but dozens of the kitchen servants all saw it clearly
Watching Chang Yangke gradually disappearing in sight, Jian Chen reluctantly shook his head and walked toward his place of residence	 The fourth master really did beat one of the servants, as well as lift up a servant who weighed 100 pounds more than him, before tossing him five meters away
He knew that in the next, I am afraid he would be severely criticized	 The most important part is that this very same servant is of the third Saint Force layer
"What, Chang Bo, you wouldn't be kidding me	”', 'Hearing Chang Bai, Changyang Ba’s eyes widened in awe from this piece of incredible news
" In a study, Chang Yangfu, the head of Changyang House, suddenly stood up from his chair and stared at the old man standing opposite	', 'Chang Bai looked at the clan leader, and after some hesitation, continued to say, “My lord, I also received more information about this, but the fourth master was recently involved in a spar with the third master
The tone said in surprise	 Using a single tree branch, the fourth master was able to injure the third master!”', '“What? Xiang’er and Ke Er fought, and Xiang’er was the victor?” With each passing second, Changyang Ba’s eyes widened more and more
The old man was the steward of Changyang Prefecture, Chang Bo	', '“That is correct my lord
Chang Bo nodded affirmatively and said, with seriousness: "I don't believe in this matter," but there are dozens of people in the kitchen who clearly see that the four young masters did a kitchen work	 The fourth master had used only a tree branch while the third master was using a wooden axe
The guy was injured, and in the end he even raised the weight of a hundred kilograms of the man and threw it five meters away, and most importantly, the man himself was a possessor	” Chang Bai added
The strength of the three-story Holy Power	', '“How is this possible!” Changyang Ba flew from his chair once more, “Xiang’er is unable to use the Saint Force, while Changyang Ke is 3 years older and is also at the third Saint Force layer
"After listening to these words, the surprised look in the eyes of Changyang’s tyrants was stronger, and the faintness was still somewhat unbelievable	 Combined with the fact that Ke Er practices martial arts everyday, how was he not able to beat Xiang’er?”', 'Taking out a tree branch from within his robes, Chang Bai held it out for Changyang Ba to take, “My lord, the fourth master had used this tree branch to beat the third master
Chang Bo looked at the Changyang tyrant and hesitated the meeting slightly	”', 'Changyang Ba took the tree branch that was no thicker than his fingers
Again, he said, “The owner, just after I received the news, when the four young masters competed in the garden with the three young masters, they used only one branch to beat the three young masters	 Inspecting it over, he noticed the tip of it had been dyed with blood
Was injured	', 'Changyang Ba focused onto the dried up blood on the broken tip of the branch while concealing all sorts of emotions from his face, “Chang Bai, is Ke Er fine?”', '“The third master is uninjured besides some broken skin
""What, Xiang Er and Keer made a contest	” Chang Bai replied
Xiang Er actually injured Ke	', 'Changyang Ba nodded his head slowly with a neutral face
" Chang Yang Pa's tone was full of surprise again	 Inspecting the tree branch even more closely, he started to grow more and more suspicious
"Yes, the homeowner, and the four masters use only one branch, and the three young masters use a wooden axe	 Finally, he spoke, “Chang Bai, this tree branch is nothing special
" Chang Bo added	 In addition, the tip is not sharp at all
“How could this be possible!” Chang Yang Pa once again stood up from his chair and said: “Xiang Er couldn’t practice the power of the Holy Spirit	 Based on Xian Er’s strength, it is impossible for a tree branch to injure Ke Er at all
On the other hand, Ke Er was not only three years older than Xiang, but also the power of the Holy Spirit	”', 'Chang Bai nodded his head in agreement, his eye glistening with a single luster, “My lord, I just had an outrageous thought; what if the fourth master is not a cripple unable to cultivate Saint Force? Seeing the fourth master’s display of might today, perhaps the fourth master had already cultivated Saint Force to the fourth level? There would be no other way for the fourth master to beat the third master otherwise
After reaching the third floor, plus the time of practicing martial arts every day, how could it be defeated by Xiang Yu who did not martial arts?”At this time, Chang Bo suddenly appeared in the hands of a half-meter long branch, said: "The owner, the four young master is to use this branch to defeat the three young master	”', 'Hearing Chang Bai, the clan leader’s face grew bright with emotion
"The Changyang tyrant borrowed a handful of branches than the little fingers they had handed over to Chang Bo	 To treat his son who was regarded as a genius badly after being revealed as a cripple, this was Changyang Ba’s biggest regret
On the other side of the branches, it was stained with blood	', '“Chang Bai, what you’re saying is that Xiang’er is not only able to use Saint Force, but that he is actually a genius at it as well
When Chang Yang Pa's eyes fell on the blood that had dried up at the break of the branches, his face suddenly became dignified	” Changyang Ba’s voice began to tremble with emotion
"Chang Bo, Ke Er is all right	 For a 7 year old to reach the fourth layer of Saint Force, this could only be accomplished by geniuses of the Tian Yuan continent
""The three young masters are all right, but they just broke the skin	 On average, by the time someone reached the fourth layer of Saint Force, they would be ** years old
" Chang Bo replied	', 'TL Note: Raws say **', 'Chang Bai nodded his head, “I have watched fourth master grow up since he was a child
Chang Yang Pa nodded slightly, his face looked good, then carefully looked at the branch several times in his hand, and the look in his eyes became more and more confused, and finally could not help but said: "Chang Bo This is just an ordinary branch that can no longer be normal, and the tip is also very flat	 He is an outstanding genius in my eyes, and I believe in him
With the strength of Xiang, using this branch can not hurt the child	 I can tell that the fourth master will be able to surpass even me in the future 
After listening to these words, Chang Bo nodded slightly, but in his eyes, he gradually revealed a hint of wisdom, saying: “I have a bold speculation, the owner, maybe the four young masters may not be the ones who cannot practice the power of the Holy Spirit, and look at the young masters today	”', 'Changyang Ba started to tremble and shake as he listened, his eyes expressing rapt excitement and minor disbelief
In the performance, perhaps the four young masters have already cultivated the power of the Holy Spirit, and at least it is the strength of the fourth layer of Holy Power	', 'Chang Bai continued to speak, “Back when the fourth master was revealed to be a cripple unable to cultivate Saint Force, I had found it quite strange
Otherwise, the four young masters cannot defeat Qiu II who has the power of three layers of Holy Spirit	 I had always found this situation to be fishy, but I couldn’t figure out exactly what was off until today
"Wen Yan, Changyang tyrant face slightly happy, and the eyes have gradually appeared a trace of excitement, for this talented childhood, but it can not practice the four sons, this has always been the biggest regret Changyang Pa mind	 With the fourth master’s two displays of strength today, I’m finally able to confirm my suspicions; the fourth master was never a cripple, but indeed a genius of cultivation
“Chang Bo, do you mean that Cheung can not only cultivate the power of the Holy Spirit, but also a cultivation genius	”', 'Changyang Ba deeply inhaled to calm down his increasing heart rate, but before he could say anything more, a clans member came running in and said to him respectfully, “My lord, the third master has been injured
” Chang Yang Pa tone slightly trembling, full of emotion	 The third lady wishes for the lord to come visit right away
At the age of seven, it reached the fourth level of the Holy Power	”', '“I understand, you may leave
This was placed on the Tianyuan mainland and indeed was a rare genius	” Changyang Ba waved his hand, dismissing the clan member indifferently
After all, under normal circumstances, it usually takes about age to reach the fourth level of Holy Power	', '“Yes my lord!” The clan member bowed respectfully before slowly exiting
Chang Bo nodded slightly and said: “I’m watching him grow up with the four young masters	', 'Changyang Ba looked back at the housekeeper, “Chang Bai, it would be best if we head on over while checking up on Xiang’er
His talent is extraordinary	 He has been neglected for so long after all
I look very clearly	” After he had spoke, he immediately paused gravely
For the four young masters, I always hold great expectations in my heart	 “Chang Bai, the two servants that dared to bully Xiang’er in the kitchen, I’ll leave it to you to drive them away from my mansion
I feel that in the near future, the accomplishments of the four masters will surely surpass me	 Hmph, those two lowly servants, to think that they could bully Changyang Ba’s son without consequences
"Hearing the words behind Chang Bo, Chang Yang's body couldn't help but feel a slight tremble, and his eyes could not believe and look ecstatic	”', 'Chang Bai laughed briefly, “My lord, those two servants have already long since been driven off
Chang Bo continued: “When I first learned that the four young masters were a waste person who could not cultivate the power of the Holy Spirit, I also felt very strange	 Although one of them was introduced by the first lady Ling Long, the other servant’s older brother is the leader of one of the team captains of the patrol guards
I always felt that it seemed a little wrong, but I still didn’t understand exactly where it came from	 But since they dared to bully the fourth master, they no longer have any reason to stay behind in this mansion
The problem, up till now, from the two things that the four young masters have done, I only confirmed that my previous guess was correct	 Otherwise, I would not dare to show face around the Changyang Mansion ever again
The four young masters are not those who cannot cultivate the power of the Holy Spirit	”', '……', 'In a largely decorated room, the recently injured Changyang Ke lay on the bed
Instead, they are still a practicing genius	 With a pale face, he stared at the freshly bandaged wound on his stomach
”Chang Yang Pa took a deep breath and slowly calmed down his excitement	', 'Sitting at the edge of the bed was Changyang Ke’s mother Yu Feng Han, with a look of distress as she tended to her son
When he was about to say something, suddenly a Jia Ding ran in and said respectfully to Changyang’s tyrant	 Not too far away, Jian Chen and his mother Bi Yuntian, as well as first aunt Ling Long, second aunt Bai Yushuang, and second sister Changyang Mingyue all stood around the bed
“The owner, the three young masters were injured	', 'Yu Feng Han looked back at Bi Yuntian with an angry look, “Fourth sister, your treasured son is getting more and more outrageous
The three ladies asked the owner to take a trip	 To have assaulted my Ke Er with such a dangerous weapon; it’s a good thing my Ke Er is very strong and didn’t suffer a deadly wound
""You know, you retreat	 Otherwise, who knows how this might have gone?”', 'Jian Chen scowled as he listened to her, not accepting her words even a tiny bit, “This can’t be blamed on me, it was third brother who had asked me to spar with him
" Changyang tyrant waved and said plainly	 A small injury like this is unavoidable
"Yes!" Jia Ding replied respectfully and slowly, he retired	 Besides, I was not using a dangerous weapon, but a tree branch
Changyang Pa eyes to the steward Chang Pei, light laughed: "Chang Bo, not as good as we have to look at the past, by the way also to care about Xiang children, this time really cold Xiangxiang children	 If anyone is to blame, then it is third brother’s lack of skill
" Said here, Changyang Pa 微微一He said in a serious tone: "Chang Bo, the two kitchen guys who bullied Xiang, still bothered you to drive them out of my house in Changyang	”', 'Yu Feng Han’s face went ashen at Jian Chen’s remarks; what he had said made perfect sense and she could not refute them in any way
Hey, two people, and they actually bullied the son of Changyang Pa	', 'Just thinking about how she had been outspoken against by a mere child, an unholy rage rose up within her
"Chang Bo smiled a little and said: “The owner, those two people, I have driven them out of Fuchu	 Along with the words, “If anyone is to blame, then it is third brother’s lack of skill
Even though one of them was introduced by Mrs	”, Yu Feng Han’s face went from green to white in rapid succession
Dai, the other is the younger brother of Fuchu’s guard captain Hill, but he dares to bully himself	 These words meant that her son was no stronger than a cripple who could not even cultivate Saint Force at all
On the head of the four young masters, they didn't have to stay in Fuchu	', 'Hearing that Yu Feng Han be beaten by a child, Bai Yushuang could not help but laugh merrily, while Ling Long sat there with an expressionless face
Otherwise, I would like to see where my face in Changyang Prefecture is	', '\xa0\xa0', '', '']
"In a large and luxuriously decorated room, Changyangke, who was injured by the sword dust, was lying on the bed, his face a little pale, and the wound on his chest had been carefully wrapped	
On the bedside, Chang Yangke's mother Yu Fengyan looked at his son with a painful look, not far away, Jian Chen and his mother Pik Wan Tin, and the big aunt exquisite, the second aunt Bai Yushuang, the second sister Changyang Mingyue	
All stood in the room	
Yu Fengyan looked back and stared at Pik Wan with angrily	
The tone was a bit gloomy: "Sister-in-law, your baby son is really getting bolder	
He actually used a weapon to inflict Ke on it	
It was okay for me	
Kerry’s life is big and the injury is not serious	
Otherwise, I really don’t know what kind of consequences it will cause	
”After listening to these words, Jian Chen frowned and said unconvincingly: “This is no wonder that I was the third brother to take the initiative to call me to compete with him	
It is inevitable that the two sides will suffer minor injuries	
What I use is not a murder weapon	
It's just a branch	
If you want to blame, then you can only blame the elder brother for not being able to learn	
”Yu Fengyan is said to be angry by the sword dust this face of iron green, but why the words of the sword dust said it makes sense, so that Yu Feng Yan can not find a word	
When I think of myself as being distressed by a teenager, Yu Fengyan raises an unknown anger in his mind, especially the last sentence of the sword dust: “You must blame the third brother for bad learning skills” This sentence, let Yu Feng Yan burst of green and white for a while, this is not to pick out that his own son is not as good as a person unable to cultivate the power of the saint	
See Yu Fengyan actually was a guilty child to gas into this, Bi Yun Tian and Jian Chen's two aunts feel a burst of fun, only the big aunt exquisite expressionless
