The fat man doubted: "Hey, according to the two of you, this Wharton gotSuch a figure should have been famous beforeBut why haven't you heard anyone say in the past? The bald man nodded: "I was puzzled by this question, and I checked it."This Wharton has not participated in any competition at O'Brien College for many years and does not engage any expertSo there is no reputation"" There is strength, it does not show"The blue-haired man sighed with the obese man"Don't mention it"The bald man speaks for himself." Since this year's seventh grade O'Brien, the Wharton will surely be even more dazzling.In the secluded pub, lei is sipping wine, but his face is smiling."Little Wharton, two meters two? But it's higher than me.“Wharton was only six years old when she left Wushan Town. At that time, Little Wharton had tiger teeth and was very cute.In an instant, eleven years passed"Little Wharton!" lei rose in the heart of a warm feeling, it is a fraternal affection"Wharton's Dragon Blood Warrior has a higher blood concentration than me. This soldier's talent is also stronger than me.Seventeen defeated eighth-level warrior? Well ... It is estimated that Wharton should reach the level of seven soldiers two or three years ago.Lei guess goodWhen he was only six years old, Wharton traveled to O'Brien College with his housekeeper, Shiri, and Wharton's gift naturally went straight to O'Brien College.But the housekeeper Hiri understood that the Baruch family still belonged to the Holy Alliance.So he kept Wharton hiddenDo not expose it casuallyIf Wharton light is too bright, I am afraid that after graduating, O'Brien will not easily let Wharton return to the Holy Alliance.Wharton has also been closely following the enlightenment of Hilary, although occasionally exposed a little strength when he was youngMay be too young to be noticedWhen he is sensible, he naturally knows it.Years of penanceEspecially at O'Brien College, Wharton’s cultivation efficiency is extremely high at the highest institution in the country where the first soldier is strong.When Wharton was 14 years old, Hillman was under the guise of lei.Only arrived at O'Brien CollegeIn fact, when Hillman arrived in the royal capital, the day of destruction had already occurred.The royal family and some other nobles have already heard of this news through the special messaging system of the Empire.The elite college of O'Brien Academy, this elite empire, naturally knew this news very early.When Hillman arrived in the Imperial Capital, Wharton knew that the day of destruction had occurred.The news that Hillman had died of Hogg and the news that his eldest brother, lei, decided to take revenge told Wharton.Walton was suddenly coveredHe doesn't know what to doThere are Hillman, Housekeeper, Shiri, and others beside them.Wharton was determined to shoulder the responsibility of the family, but Wharton had always worried about his brother, Lin, and Wharton did not know what his brother was like.The sacred alliance is too far away from O'Brien's empire, and it will take only one year to travel alone.Fortunately, the Dawson Chamber of Commerce found Wharton and sent a secret letter to Wharton.The secret letter is written by Yale and details the lei and the Holy See.With Clyde's grudgeAlso told Wharton, lei nothing, just started a long-term penance aloneWharton learns this newsI was relievedHowever, Wharton is also increasingly proud of his eldest brother. At the same time, Wharton is determined to work harder and later join hands with his older brother.Wharton had worked hard in the past, and Wharton was hard at work in the following three years.At the age of fifteen, Wharton reached the level of seven warriorsWhen I was 17When Wharton used the sword knife to scull, he decided that he would finally participate in the first grade when he had achieved a certain level of success.This is a grade gameWharton was a blockbuster, and for a time became the most dazzling star in the capitalThe emperor also gave him his earl林 lei sitting in the pub, feeling happy as never before"Boss, Wharton? That's your younger brother, right?" Babe was crouching in his chair. At the moment, he was watching lei with that yo yo eyes.Lei nodded with a smile"That little kid can beat the eighth-level warrior"Bebe marveled," Boss, your brother can also become a dragon blood warrior""Of courseLei is very proud of his brother, "bebe, I was the blood of dragon blood warriors who evoked the blood through the back of an armored armored dragon."My brother, the Dragon Blood Warrior, has a blood concentration that is higher than mine and can become a Dragon Blood Warrior.But his transformation is different from mine.Lei remembers the mention of 'dragonblood' in the family's bookThe blood concentration of the Dragon Blood Warrior is high enough, and then it becomes a Dragon Blood Warrior directly after cultivating the "Dragon Blood Code." The normal form is a blue dragon scale with a blue dragon tail and a dragon horn on the forehead.The lei form is full of black dragon scales, with black spikes on the forehead, back, elbows and knees. The tail is also black.“Everybody comes with a bottle of emerald green” A lei familiar voice sounded in the pub"This is?" leilei as thunderbolt, the whole body is stiff for a moment, and immediately after soul transfer to babe: "bebe, you come to my side, do not come outLei put babe in his chairThis pub is very darkAnd each table is isolated by screens.Lei's body is almost blocked by the screen, and the acquaintance can not see leiLei turned his head and revealed a little eyes and looked at the past - that fat body, laughing into a line of eyes"Sure enough, heLei immediately retracted his head, "red cardinal archbishop ramposon, how could it appear in the O'Brien EmpireAlso, several people next to him are not weak hands.There was also one of the cultivators who was at the top of the Temple of Light."The pensive one was one of the cultivators who had been with Hattins. That person was also <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></span> Div> StrongLampson alone, and the cultivator are two nine strong ones."I don't know a few other people, but when I look at that breath, I think it's even worse than Lampson.Maybe it is also a nine-level strong"LEI heart shocked"In this place of the county of the county of Hilgue, there were so many masters of the Holy See.Is it that ... ... "LEI heart surprised," Is it my identity exposed? "Lin knewSuch as the existence of the Great Holy See, the Great Holy See, in other empire is definitely an intelligence network.Only that intelligence network is even dense with a county town? "Boss, how is it?" Bebe is still in confusion, he was ordered by lei not allowed to come out and wonderingLei looked to babe, mouth has a hint of laughter, the voice said: "bebe, the master of the bright church came, there should be a few nine strong"" The Holy See? "Bebe's eyes killer flash"They have to startI let them all be inseparable from the county"Lee has a murderous heartToday, the strength of lei is much stronger than it wasWhen it was Longhua, it was completely nine peaksAnd now, with the use of black tactical swords, lei has reached the pinnacle of 'potential' and gradually touches another higher level of existence.Lei listen carefully with his earObviously, several people of the Holy See did not discover the existence of lei."For this guy, it took two yearsFinally, in ten days and a half months, we can go back"Lampson's voice is very lowLampson is also very careful not to disclose anything that may reveal his identity"Two yearsAnother man in a black robe with his back to lei shook his head and said"In order to deal with this old guy, my good brothers are dead.""As long as you do a good job, everything is worth itSaid Lampson... Hear the conversations with a few peopleLei brow crease"What do you mean?" He killed six super deacons once, but he can't be an old man himself."Old guy? Also said they want to go back?" lei some understand, these people come here, it should be to deal with another personLei began to be strange, in the end is what people worth the light"old manWhat to see"One of the black robes slams at the road"What is it?" an old voice sang. "If it weren't for your deception, there were other means.I will fall into your hands and really dreamLei eyelids liftedIt seems that the veteran of this old voice is the one that the Bright Catholic Church attaches great importance to."It was against me. The Holy See also did not send a large number of masters to other countries.Instead, what is this old man...? Lei thought"Anyway, regardless of who this old man is, I am sure to save"lei sneer sneer, "can destroy the important plan of the Vatican, but also a little bit to make my heart comfortable"It is too difficult to uproot the Supreme Church of Light.Step by step nowWaited for about an hour or so, a group of people such as Lampson finally left the pub with the old man. From beginning to end, a group of people did not see the lei after the screen.Lei walked out from the screen"Babe, let's goLei threw a handful of gold coins to pay the bills, and immediately took bebe quietly out from the tavern, followed by a group of people behind LampsonToday, lei's understanding of 'potential' has reached a peakBy relying solely on the understanding of 'potentials', one can step on the water without sinking. It is impossible for ordinary nine-class strongmen to achieve this.This is the realm, not just simply fighting and strongWalking on the road, as long as others can not see the lei, absolutely do not feel that the back is actually someone, behind a group of people behind Lampson, lei finally see the other person"Six persons of the Holy See are alive, plus a mysterious old man who is escortedLei at the moment have a kind of feeling, six people on the bright side of the Holy See, are nine strongSix nine strong, escort an old manAnd let the Red Archbishop Lambson personally lead the teamAfter listening to them, it seems that Lampson is equal to a group of people spending two years on this matter, and many people died during the process."What is this old man coming from?" LEI also noticed the old man's appearance slightly from the rear.Extremely thin, the white eyebrows actually hang down to the chestThe most important thing is that this old man is carrying a pair of hands.There is only a piece of cloth on the curtain.Most people don’t pay attention to itLei is also trailing for a long time, because that Mengbu was blown by the wind, only to see the depression under the mb"Eh? That is ..." lei first saw this legendary tool, "forbidden magic handcuffs?" book records, all banned magic handcuffs with, the body's magic can no longer use a littleThe stronger magician must be like an ordinary personHowever, the banned magic handcuffs are rare and valuable, and this is the first time LEI has seen it.Lei people shaking the crowd in the street, sometimes to avoid, sometimes forward, elegant, Rampson few people can not feelAfter a while, Lampson arrived in an alley and stopped in front of a two-story building courtyard. A man in a black robe knocked on the door."grown upThe courtyard door opened and a middle-aged man came out respectfully. "Everything is ready, and the adults will rest."Lampson and others nodded"Kosats, your two brothers looked at this old guy firstAfter a while we went to change classesSaid LampsonLei heart secretly scared: "even with the banned magic handcuffs, have to watch so tight, this old man really is not ordinary" lei more and more want to destroy the plan of the Holy See(Today's first chapter, yesterday did not update, today will update three chapters, first fill in one chapter!)
