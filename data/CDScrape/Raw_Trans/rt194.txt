"I think I have the abilityKeane said firmly.Mrs. Weed faced her face and said, "Keane, calm down, you are still just a child.The lord of the county of the county of Hear, however, manages millions of imperial people. This burden you can't afford now.At this time, Ginn, next to Keane, said with a loud voice: "Auntie, the imperial law can't say it. It must be adult before he can inherit the position of the city."Wade Lady Looks at GianniGiannis looked at Lady Widder without giving in, and the women of two different ages looked at each other."Correct"Mrs. Weede said with a smile." There is no clear rule in imperial law that must be grown up to inherit the position of the city.But..." Mrs. Wiede mourned. "After your father died, the clan learned about the news here. It was originally your oldest brother who inherited the position of the landlord, but my poor child..." “When I learned that Keane was only 14 years old, the people of the clan gave orders. This is the county of the county of Chilborough, which is one of the most important county towns in the northwestern province of the province. It is also close to the provincial capital of Basil, Chelsea County. The management of the city is very important. The clan ordered Keane to take over the position of the landlord after he became an adult."" Clan? "Keane, Gianni are all hereHearing this is the command of the Sovereign, Jenny and Keane’s siblings are also somewhat ignorant.As members of the Jakes family, Gianni and Keen, they know the meaning of the clan."Aunt, did the clan really have such an order?" Gianni stared at Mrs. Widder.Mrs. Widder frowned and looked at Jenny: "JennyDo you think that I will also pass on clan orders? Well, before Keane did inherit the city, everything in the county was for the time being hosted by me.""I am the future city owner. I have the power to establish who is the acting city owner.Keen shouted with dissatisfactionLady Weed looks coldly into KeaneAnd has been quietly next to the lei finally screamed: "Mrs. Widder, your so-called clan, there should be no order, let you act as a proxy city owner, right?" Lady Weed a lagShe was bold again and dared not indiscriminately create the orders of the clanJenny and Keane belong to the Jax family, and the Jax family is one of the most powerful clans in the entire O'Brien Empire.Northwest Province, one of the seven major provinces of the O'Brien Empire, controlled by the Jax familyAnd Gianni, Keen's father Weed & JaxJust beside the jux family, if not for the Jax familyHow could Weed & Jax, the coward, be a county town landlord? Widder is dead nowIn the Jacques’ family’s view, this county town of Chire County still naturally has to play for the Jax family’s staff.Lady WeedAlthough married to Weed, but Mrs. Weeds is not the bloodline of the Jacques family after all, the Jacques family is unlikely to take the position of the deputy to let Lady Weed to sit.“Oh, if it wasn’t the old clans...” Mrs. Wade’s heartHer wife, Wiede, was even more powerful and unable to compare with the Jakes clan.People's words, I'm afraid her noble lady will have to go to the streets tomorrow"I am not a man. My sister is an adult.I will send people to the provincial capital ‘Basil’I believe that the clan eldersWill let my sister act as the agent of the city, not you!

The more arrogant Ms. Weeds, the more Keen will resist.Keane also believes that the clan will definitely stand on his side. After all, he is a child of the Jax family.After the banquetLei, jenny, keane, lambert stayed with a few people, lei fully understand after the inquiry, jenny, Keane's Jax family how powerfulTheir father, Widder & Jax, was only a neighbor.The real clan clan, the power is very deafThe entire northwestern province is entirely controlled by the Jax family and is hereditary.The Jax family has a thousand years of history in the northwest province."The royal family of O'Brien, really confidentEven dare to hand over a province to a family management millenniumLei sighed in his heartA territory of provinces and territories is bigger than Kingdom of FinlayLet a family manage the province for a long time. It's easy for a family to have amazing power.This is also a factor in ‘fabrication’ and 'lie’.However, O'Brien’s royal family is confidentBecause they have the presence of the 'Vulcan', there are a large number of strong people with the Wu Shen Men.And the two most important provinces of O'Brien’s empire, the “Central Bank Province” and the “O'Brien Provincial”, are controlled by royalty."There is a martial arts god, and no family dares toNot to mention the martial arts, that is, the disciples of the martial arts gates for thousands of years, that is, the power of terror.Lei understandIn the face of the peerless, the so-called army is just a joke.The army is only deterrent to secular peopleHowever, the strong sanctuary is the most important point in determining the fate of a country.“The strength of the Jax family, which has been in charge of the Northwest Province for over a thousand years, is probably amazing.Lei heart tunnel"Hey, that hot woman, I don't believe that the clan will support him.Keane said angrily<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Lambert is laughing: "Master, you can rest assured.If the clans support her, I’m afraid she’s just another look today."indeed soAt the moment, Mrs. Weed was really annoyed: “The country’s siblings are so arrogant. It’s really...

A middle-aged man ran out of clothing and he just got up from the bed.The Countess"The middle-aged man suddenly saw Lady Weed, and she suddenly felt a tremble in her heart.Lady Weed said bluntly: "According to the investigation, Hallmer was arrested for assassinating the successor to the city's Keane.Now all people of the Holmes family are detainedFamily property will be checkedWhen I heard this, the middle-aged man had a soft legCan't help falling down"No, CountessThe middle-aged man quickly said, "My grandfather, but your two brothers invited..."

"Hallmo was arrested for the assassination of Master Keane. All of the Holmes family took it back. The resistance was to kill.The knight, who was headed, said bluntly that the people in the Hallmouth House were all silly to hear these orders.In front of the fierce guards of the city, those people were caught one by one powerlessly.However, there are still many people who do not want to go to bed, they immediately fled to escapeThe City Guards also stalked the past one after another"Weed that bitch"A gray-haired old man," she asked her grandfather, but now my grandfather died.
