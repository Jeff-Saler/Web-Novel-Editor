Spring came to the autumn, and in the blink of an eye, lei has stayed for more than half a year at Ernst College.In the days of Ernst College, lei was like a thirsty desert traveler, eager to learn the basic knowledge of the magician, in the wind magic, lei's awareness and strength are also constantly improvingAnd Drinkovt will also put forward some of his own opinions in due course.On this day, sunnyThe four brothers who had lunch in the 1987 quarters wore a pair of sky blue robes, which were the standard clothing issued by the college.Because of long-term exercise, slender tall lei wear a sky blue robe, there is a more special charm, it is no wonder that the wind of a few little girls often like to talk with lei after classAt the moment, the four brothers are walking and talking"Yes, lei, we are going to the new fraternity this afternoon. Will you go?" George said with a smile.George is very enthusiastic about public activities. He is also good at inquiries and he is good at making friends.Although he entered school for six months, George was considered a man of the year in the first year of Ernst College."Not to goLei said neatly"Haha, I know that lei will definitely not participateRenault said with a laugh next to himYelling lei shoulders lei sighed: "I said lei, you do not practice too hard, ah, with your qualifications, as long as a little hard work, within 30 years to reach the level 6 magician absolutely no problemWhat are you doing so hard? It's time to enjoy lifeThe cute little girl can be quite a few at the sorority"Yeah, it's so cute.Renault said with a wide eyeLei laughed helplesslyRenault’s innocent youngster, under the leadership of Yale, had been 'misguided'."Yale, you're the gangster don't pull me, OK, I should go and practiceTomorrow will be the end of the month, tomorrow will accompany you to play too lateLei said with a smileAt the end of each month and two days, it is also two days that lei took a vacation for himself.Yale, Renault and George all knew that lei's temperament and noddedLei immediately stepped forward and swiftly and quickly ran toward the back of the college. There were thousands of individual trainees in the entire Ernst College. There were also many magicians who had conducted research and experiments at Ernst College.There are also many service staff, and there are many people at Ernst College.Along the way, I also saw many students dressed in sky blue robes"Hey ~ ~" low noise soundedLei leapt to see it, could not help but brighten his eyes: "Warcraft!" elegant mane, smooth cyan fur, and that powerful limbs, that pair of wild cold spells contained in the wolf's unique spicy, that The cold claws of metallic luster are even more chillingWorld of Warcraft 'Wind Wolf'With the speed of the wind as the horror of WarcraftIn the WoW Forest, the most terrifying thing is to meet a group of wolfs. Once you meet a group of wolfs, it is difficult to escape with the speed of the wolf.At this moment, the majestic wind wolf is sitting on a handsome black-haired young man. The black-haired youth is looking around. It seems that he is proud of having such a Warcraft."This estimate is for students in the fifth or sixth gradeLei in the heart to judgeThere are indeed many people who have World of Warcraft in Ernst College. In addition to the special magicians hired by Ernst College, there are also some fifth-grade and sixth-grade students.These trainees buy the soul-contract scroll and regain some of Warcraft's mounts."Not a World of Warcraft, is it worth being proud?" lei is so proud of the dark-haired young people do not careOut of the back door of the college, step into the back of the mountainThe backstreet of Ernst College is extremely vast. In the long and long time ago, there were still the world of Warcraft in the back of the mountain, but afterwards, the entire World of Warcraft was completely killed by the magicians of the college.There are some ordinary beasts in the mountains after now.Once in the mountains, lei suddenly speed up the whole person upThe wind-assisted magic ‘‘speed’’ naturally unfolds. lei’s lightness is like a fallen leaf. It dexterously shuttles through the mountains. It ran for a few miles, and lei reached its own destination, an open space near the stream."Hey ~ ~" Beibei shouted to Lin LeiLei smiled, entrusted: "have to go out to play? Well, but play outside but don't run too farLei still very reassuring to beibei, from the first time to see babe has been in the past year's time, although the shadow mouse has not grown in size, still about twenty centimeters long, but the speed is a lot faster"Magician? If it is an 8th-class fighter, you may catch the shadow rat. If it is a magician, unless it is a holy magician" lei can be very clear that the magician's physiqueThe little mouse ‘bebe’ entered the forest once"Grandpa Delin, come out and guide me.Lei immediately shouted in her heartA mist flew out and turned into Drincowort, and Drincowort looked at him quips: "LEI, what's going on today? Didn't you always meditate and ignore my old man? Now how do you find me? I just slept soundly, oh, you've got a sweet dream"<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> lei lickedGrandpa Delin, don't look at him as a sanctuary. He can be contacted for a long time, and he knows that the appearance is kind and kind, but his heart is just like the urchin.“Grandpa Delrin, I feel like I’ve reached the realm of the second magician now, I’d like you to help me test it.Lei said this purpose"The second magician?" Drinkovol calculated: "Oh, it's been a year and a half since you started learning magic with me. Well, you're using Elemental Magic's Breaking Stones." Give me a look. To reach your limit, you know?" The broken stone, this is a growth magicIn the first class magic, there is a ‘chipping stone’, but among the taboo magic there is also a ‘chipping stone’, but that time the name was... ‘陨石天降”With the increase of the strength of land magicians, the power of this ‘spattering stone’ naturally increases."Yes, Grandpa DelinLei immediately meditation magic spell, that gargle curse has been lin leian's skill to not think of the brain can read out, with the meditation magic spell, lei feel their entire soul into a special stateThe magic of the land in the chest immediately surged, and the elements between heaven and earth were also attracted.Suddenly the land next to it crackedI saw only five skull-size stones flying up and then levitating above LEI’s head.The surface of the five stones was surrounded by yellowish light. As the eyes of Lin Lei suddenly brightened, and the sound in the mouth was low, the five stones slammed toward the distance, and they even brought a gust of wind."Pang!" Five stones surrounded by yellowish rays linger at the same time on a rough trunk. The trunks are shaken up and they are still broken. The five stones finally fall down."Well, very good"Derlin Corvette's eyes light up," could even control five pieces of broken stone at the same time, that flying speed is also very good, there is indeed a second magician strength"For Lin's performance, Deling Kewater is very satisfiedLin Lei could not help but face a smileI'm getting closer to the goalBefore leaving, what the father said could not be forgotten by lei: "If you don't take it back, I will not forgive you even if I die!" This sentence is like a knife hanging over the heart of lei, all the time Whip leiAnd at the moment, Drincowutter smiled and said: "But lei, you have to know, the second magician can't count anything.According to the magician's grading, Level 1 and Level 2 are both primary, Level 3 and Level 4 are intermediate, and Level 5 and Level 6 are advanced.The 7th-level magician is also known as the ‘great magician’, the 8th-level magician is also called the ‘magister’, and the 9th magician is also called the ‘magician’. The 7th to 9th level is the most powerful.The road you want to go is still far away""I knowLei nodded"Well, do yourself a good job?"Drincowwater again entered the ring of dragonsLei is the excitement of convergence to reach the second magician, once again sit down and sit down quietly to meditateThe strong ones are step by step, relying on every effort to build up.In a place about two or three miles from the leiLEI's wind magic teacher, the sixth-level magician Ray, frowned at this time: "Oh, what is the magic of the shard?"The junior magician went to the mountains to practice? Who is it? When Trey played the magic of the wind and discovered the wind, he just sensed the magic of the magic of the lei beyond two or three miles.From magical fluctuations, Trey can judge this magicTracy walked curiously in that direction. The assistive magic ‘‘speed’’ displayed by the strength of the Teresa’s sixth-level magician was not comparable to that of lei’s.I saw Terre as a fog, drifting light and fast in the mountainsJust a moment later, Trey appeared more than 100 meters away from the lei.Standing by a big tree, Tray observed the distant lei"Is he?" Tray knew his students, of course. "This is called lei's kid. He hasn't spoken much in class. When he tried to do magic, others tried to use magic. He never stood still. Display strengthIt turns out that this guy named lei is a two-stage magician. I remember that he is still a new student.Did not expect to be a genius" lei will of course magic, so the teacher in the classroom let the students try, lei are only looking at the sideDo not participate in group activities, the mystery of lei, it is recognized by his students recognized"Hey, there is such a genius among my students. Oh, this year's first grade, I should get some bonuses."Terry's face is smiling brightlyAt the moment, lei who entered the state of meditation did not feel the presence of Trey at 100 meters.
