The channels of the halls lined both sides with rich nobles. These nobles were not separated by a channel. The two Ghettos of the Holy See were Gilmer, Lampson, and King Clyde of the Kingdom of Finlay. The main director of the Guild Hall is Maia, the master of Yale of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce, and the magic genius master stone lionThese people walked in the center, laughing and talking to each other outside the Prusz."Yoshikuni Adult, Ranpu Mori Adult""His Majesty"" lei master"...and the surrounding nobles are smiling one by one and humbly saying hello to them."And several people in the Debus family are being squeezed in.Alice, with a low hat, couldn't help but lifted his head and looked at the ‘lei’ being complimented by many nobles and rich people.Today's lei is the most legendary geniusSeventeen-year-old seven-level magician, and in the field of stone carving to achieve the same level with Prouks, Hopkinson, Hoover and other mastersSuch a genius, nature looks like the brightest stars in the skyGradually, the two archbishops of Red, Clyde, lei, Yale and others left.All the nobles and rich people left this one by one."You are Alice"A crisp voice rang suddenlySeveral people of the Debus family looked backwardsI saw a beautiful blond girl walking over and behind her was a smiling old man.Regardless of whether it is this blonde girl or the old man, there is an aristocratic atmosphere that comes from the bones, and it makes people feel a little inferior to each other.When Bernard looked, he stepped forward and said modestly: "Let's go, this is Miss Delia.I heard that Miss Delia, who was a longtime member of the Lions family, was a country of great power. When I saw it today, I was even more beautiful than the legend."The influence of the Debuss family was limited to the family of the kingdom of Finlay, compared to the super family of the Magnolia Empire, the 'Lane family'."The gap does not know how much"Oh, the chiefs of the Debuss family?" Delia glanced at Bernard.Bernard humbly nods"This is your son Carrandi's fiancée, right?” Delia glanced at Alice, who was hidden behind Cardan.Bernard immediately laughed and said: "She? No, she is not the right wife of my son Karan."" Not a real wife? Delia had a sneer on the face. Delia walked slowly towards Alice. Bernard couldn't stop it. When he walked in front of Kalan, Karan also tried to stand up. Want to block each otherBut Delia’s cold eyes made Karan feel chillIn particular, I think the other party is the big lady of the Lions family.Now the relationship between the Debuss family and the Dawson Chamber of Commerce has been terrible.The Lane family wants to deal with the Hebdebus family. It's a breeze.AliceDelia stared at Alice’s eyesAlice lifts her chinDiligently confronts Delia and tries to keep her calm.Delia laughedSaid softly: "Alice, I really do not know how lei will love you?" Alice paled, but began to say: "It's none of your business!" "It's none of my business "" Delia faintly smiled, "YesIt is not my business, but I really regret for you, but I will let go of the lei, but the result is that even a debus family cannot be a wife.I think you will regret it... but unfortunately, you will never have a chance againBecause you don't have such an intersection with leiAfter you are basically two people in the worldUnderstand? " Delia does not care about the ugly face of Karan and Alice.Looking back at Bernard"Sorry for disturbing youDelia said very politelyBernard immediately humbled himself: "Miss Delia walks slowlyThe old man beside DeliaI glanced at the blue card in a ugly face, and then I walked away behind Delia.While Bernard kept smiling and watched the other person leave until the two delia masters and servants left, Bernard looked back and glanced at Cardin and Alice."Allocation!" Bernard reprimandedKa Lan and Alice couldn't speak loudly. Several people in the Debus family went back in an unbearably depressing way.******Finlay City Lucas family office"Master lei, no, no“Marquess Jebour quickly refused to lei,” really do not need 600,000 gold coins, lei master is really sorry, I really do not know that you actually have such achievements in the field of stone carving“The obstinate old man of Marquis de Jebb, this time watching lei’s eyes is simply looking at the idolMarquis de Jebb has no other hobbies, the only hobby is the collectionFor some guru-level characters, it is naturally a heartfelt worship.I am afraid that a king of the kingdom is in front of him and it is impossible for him to admire his heart from his heart"Or don't, just pay 180,000.My family’s original 180,000 gold coins are now sold for another 180,000 yuan.This is also fairMaster lei, I'm your money, earn lei's master's money, I can not sleep well"The Marquis de Jebb was very stubborn“Marquis de Jabe, when you bought the weapon knife from my family, the Lucas family also spent 180,000 gold coins.Hundreds of thousands of gold coins hundreds of years ago, but worth more than today’s gold coinsLei may not want to occupy people's cheap- Marquis Jeb was stubbornly watching lei"Yeah, you guys, you guys are really..." next to Yale smiled and licked his stomach. "Selling things hard and squeezing them down, desperate to give it to othersIt's more money to buy thingsThis was the first time I saw thisLei reluctantly smiled: "Marquis de jeb, so be it, hundreds of thousands of years ago a hundred thousand gold coins, catch up with today's 360,000 gold coins itOn 360,000 gold coinsDon't refuse it again, otherwise I drop this magic crystal card and go straight away.Lei said also removed the magic crystal card from her armsThe Marquis of Jeb had a hard look at the lei and finally nodded. "Okay then?Lei could not help laughingThe Marquis of Jeb suddenly smiled a bit embarrassed: "Master LAM, I have a request, I do not know if I should say"" Say itLei laughed at the Marquis de JebThe Marquis of Jeb immediately waved at the next man, and the two men quickly moved out from behind an erect stone slab."Master lei, I just thought you could help leave a signature, I thinkI will keep foreverThe Marquis de Jebb looked forward to leiLei smiled and then removed a flat knife from her armsRandomly waved his hand and waved his sword and shadow, and then the surface of the slate stone suddenly broke into pieces, only three breaths of effort, and LEI took back the flat knife.However, it was blown against the slate, so the ground stone was completely thrown up, exposing two characters in a dragon dance - "Lei!" The Marquis de Jeb looked at these two words and his eyes were bright: "It's so elegantly sculpted, so beautiful writing.These two words are worth more than 360,000 gold coins."Heard thisLei can not laughFrom the city of Finlay to the town of Wushan, the muddy trees on both sides of the road are neatly arranged.Lei flew on top of the road with the tall horse. He also carried a huge box on his shoulders. The box was hundreds of pounds. Fortunately, this horse was a good horse from the Dawson Chamber of Commerce.Normal horses can't run so fast<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Behind lei, there is a cavalry troop of one hundred people.This team was sent to lei by the Gilmer Archbishop of the Holy See. According to the Holy See, the safety of lei is very important.The last time LEI was hijacked has explained everythingIn this cavalry squad, the lowest one has enough strength to be a five-level warrior, but is a squad of the Apostle of the Apostolic Trump.Hundreds of horses gallopedLeave a trail of smokeLin Lei looked at the increasingly clear town of WushanIn the mind, scenes that grew up grew up.When I was young, I trained in the empty land of Wushan Town. When I was young, I first saw the fear of the swift and violent land.The past in the eyes of leiRaptors are simply invincibleBut for today's lei, the raptor is nothing"Rumbled ~ ~" the earth oscillates, over a hundred excellent horses gallop at speed, and that vibration can be felt all the time.Many residents of Wushan town are horrified to hide on the edge of the street from afar and one by one with curiosity, embarrassment, and fear, and look at the powerful cavalry troops in the distance."Good and powerful cavalryThe Hillman who was walking in the streets of Wushan couldn’t help but look around. The simple, fast and powerful hoof sounds made Hillman's heart startle.It was in the army that he had not seen several such qualified cavalrymen.The lowest are five soldiers. How can the cavalry squad of the Apostolic Knights of the Holy See be poor in quality? The kind of galloping momentum alone makes people tremble"Who is that?" Hillman saw the first person at a glance"LeiHillman's face didn't change much, and the whole man quickly ran past the Baruch family office.The lei squad led by lei slowed down after entering wushan town. Only lei rushed towards his family.Looking at the mansion walls with mottled traces in the distance, scenes in Lin Lei’s heads appearing naturally in the palace during childhood."The Baruch family, my roots!" lei carries a box of swords and kills the box. Some of his hearts are just endless pride.Lei also clearly remembers his first departure to Ernst College, what his father said to himselfLei believed that his father said to himself, I am afraid I can never forget forever - "lei, remember the wishes of our Baruch family for hundreds of years, remember the shame of our Baruch family!" After graduating, you must have at least six magicians. As long as you work diligently and become a seven-level magician and not a thing, you will definitely be able to recapture the inheritance treasure of the family. If you don’t take it back, even if I die, it will not forgive you"" Even if I die, I will not forgive you! " ... ... that voice is constantly echoing in the minds of lei, can feel the heavy pressure of the sword on the back of the 戮 戮 , , , 林 林 心 心 心 心 心 心 心 心 心 心 心 心 心 林 林 林 林 林 林 林"Father, I'm back!" "Father, I came back with a sword and scull!" lei jumped off the horse and went straight into the mansion courtyard."Father!" lei shouted loudly"I came back and came back with a sword and a sledgehammer.Lei's voice filled with joy and excitementFamily ancestors worked hard for hundreds of yearsThe greatest hope of my father's lifeAnd now I finally finished for my father! "Fighting knife ‘slaughter’?” a voice soundedLei looked round and it was Hillman"Uncle Hillman, father? You'll let him out.Haha, I finally brought back the sword ‘Tuo’. Really, the treasure of our Dragon Blood Warrior family, I finally brought it back.You tell me where my father is. Father, he knows, he will be very, very happy.This evening, I am afraid I must have a good meal.Uncle Hillman assured, I will not resign todayYou must have a good meal with you.Lei the whole person was very excitedThe box on the back was also taken out, holding the box looking at HillmanBut... Hillman's face is not a little happy, but instead he has a bleak look."Shi, Uncle Hillman?" Lin Lei frownedLooked at Hillman, "Uncle Hillman, my father?" Hillman looked at lei, trying to squeeze a smile: "lei, you will be the sword "mast" brought back? your father knows that will be very happy Land, will certainly""What about my father? "" Your fatherheHe was dead three months agoHillman took a deep breath and said slowlyIt's already wet with eyesLei felt like a thunderbolt thunder in his ears for a moment and his brain was blank"Dangdang!" Lei Lei's box fell heavily on the groundThe lid shook and flew, revealing a murderous giant sword with a hint of red blood. The icy murderous gas and bloody air suddenly depressed the entire yard."dead?" lei incredible looking at HillmanHillman gently noddedSuddenly lei smiled: "Haha, Uncle Hillman, you must be lying to me, haha, I have brought back the knife "Musha", you see, Uncle Hillman, I will bring the sword 'Musha' When I came back, how could my father die? He still wanted to see the sword and slaughter it.Lei grabbed the knife ‘slaughter’, and that bloody atmosphere even made Hillman feel a glimpse."Uncle Hillman, you see, I brought back all the swords and sculls, and I have to tell my father that I can become a dragon warrior.Lei's hands began to scale out, just become a dragon clawTwo claws clutched Hillman's shoulders. LYN stared at Hillman: "Uncle Hillman, you see, I can be a Dragon Blood Warrior. I brought back the sword and smashed it."Really, father, my father! ! ! ""I would also like to show him the sword butcher! ""I haven't told him yet. I can already become a dragon blood warrior.""The pair of dragon claws grabbed Hillman, but the owner of this pair of dragon claws, 'Lei', looked at Hillman praying."Uncle Hillman, I beg you, tell me, where is my father?" lei is like a poor orphan who has lost everything and prays for Hillman.Like a drowning man, holding the last straw to hold HillmanHillman gently shook his head: "LEI, your father, he is dead!" lei laughed, laughing so desolated: "No, no, I would also like to show him a battle knife," I still want to tell him I can already become a Dragon Blood Warrior. I have to drink with him this evening."Talking about it, lei has burst into tearsHillman looked at lei and couldn't help but raised his head, and then the two lines of tears flowed down."No, no way!!!" lei grabbed Hill with two claws, the pair of eyes staring at Hillman, even in the eye pupils like a spine back to the cold dark armored dragon In golden color, a horror that is more horrible than the sword's killings filled the entire yard.The deep, hoarse voice came out of the throat - "Tell me, where is my father?"
