The spring breeze blows poplar trees around the open space on the eastern side of Wushan Town. On the open land, a group of teenagers are training in the heat.It has been a year and a half since the last test of blood in the blood of the Dragon Blood Warriors. Today, lei is also eight years old.In the past year and a half, Hillman has clearly discovered that lei has been training harder! "Very good, lei, insist, insist!" said hillman next to himLei just this time wearing long trousers, humming the upper body full of sweat, lei whole person like a tight string lying prone on the ground, hands clinging to the ground like the old tree roots, the entire human movement Do not move, rely on both hands and feet toe supportThe whole person is completely taut! Static tension exercise! Very simple and effective exercise, if you can maintain this state for an hour, then the body will not fear the general sword."Tick!" sweat from the forehead fell along the edge of the corner of the eye, lei could not help feeling the right eye burst of acid, can not help but right eye squat up"Ray is really powerful, only eight years old, and she is in constant tension and catches up with 13-year-olds."The children who had given up next to each other looked at lei and talked about it."Ray, cheer, cheer for us and beat those 13-year-olds"Hairley screaming beside the blonde"Come on, Ray!" The other children shoutedLei is very good with other juveniles. Although lei is considered a noble boy, he is very good for the civilian children.Usually help them train"Persist and persistLei kept talking to herselfAnd lei's mind is echoing what his father said to himself a year ago: "Lei Lei, we are a member of the Dragon Blood Warrior. As a member of the Dragon Blood Warrior family, you have advantages and disadvantages! The advantage is that even if you The blood concentration of the Dragon Blood Warrior is not enough to become a Dragon Blood Warrior. Your body is still much better than the average person.It may be difficult for others to train on the sixth level alone, but you are easier than others."" However, you also have disadvantagesThe disadvantage is that ... the children of the Dragon Blood Warrior family cannot practise the grudgeBecause of the blood of the Dragon Blood Warrior in the body, it is only suitable for the "Dragon Blood Concise Code," and it contradicts any other tactics of grudge.However, "Dragon Blood Dense Code" can only cultivate blood dragon blood to a certain extent, so you can't cultivate qi"" Still, most people simply exercise **, in theory, can reach the six soldiersBut that's just a theory. Real people like this, very, very fewHowever, we are different, even if the body dragon blood fighter is relatively rareIt also makes us start higher than othersWe simply practice **, it is possible to practice to a six-level warrior.Your great-grandfather was once just relying on his body and practicing to a level 7 warrior."My father's words, lei remembered very clearlyLei whispered in his heart: "I am more powerful than other people because of the body blood dragon warriorsHowever, I cannot practice vindictiveness. Only work hard and work hard! Grandpa Zeng can simply rely on physical training to reach the 7th-level warriors. Then I... It is possible to become an 8th-level warrior, even a 9th-level warrior. Nothing is impossible.“The eighth-level warrior! The nine-level warrior can be regarded as the first master in the Kingdom of Finland. If it becomes an eighth-level warrior, even if it is impossible for the family to reproduce the brilliance five thousand years ago, it can greatly improve the family conditions."Persist!" lei bit her teethAt this time, the ache of my arms was like a bite, and the whole body was constantly shivering. The muscles in every part of the body were shaking.The intensity of muscle tremor at each site is so clear at this momentAfter a long time, finally - "Peng!" lei fell to the ground with no power“**"stick on the ground, the body completely relaxed, lei can clearly feel his body hemp, itchingMuscles everywhere began to grow slowly after exerciseThis kind of growth is not obvious once or twice, but the progress of the body after a long time is obvious.Hillman next to nodded with satisfactionThen Hillman looked at the group of fourteen-year-olds and looked cold: “I’ve been stuck with them. I’m only eight years old. You’re almost all grown up. Don’t go down to an eight-year-old."****** The end of the morning exercise, after lei separated from a group of good friends, she returned to the baruch family office as usual.Lin Lei, who was only eight years old, would have thought that he would be an eleven-year-old boy rather than an eight-year-old if he was not familiar with it.The children of the Baruch family are indeed different from ordinary people."Brother!" Warren sees lei, and suddenly he rushes forward."Well, Wharton, I'm sweaty. Let me wash it first.Lei pinched Wharton's little face and said with a smileWharton groaned: "I know, my brother, you're going to go to father's class after you've washed it."<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> lei as a nobleman, aristocratic education that is to start small, Baruch family, there are five The ancient family, which has a history of more than a thousand years, is even harsher in education than the great aristocracy of the kingdom."Well, Wharton, noon brother to accompany you to playLei said with a smileWharton is still a child, but lei has to understand moreAfter washing, changed a set of clean clothes, LEI entered the living room, and this time his father Hogg & Baruch, straight back sitting beside the dining table next to the living roomIn the face of Hogg, there are three thick books"Father!" lei bowed respectfullyHogger nodded indifferently, LEI even walked to Hoge's side and stood nearby."Yesterday I told you about all the countries in the entire Magnolia continent. You repeat it now.Hogg said indifferentlyThis is the real HoggLike holding lei in the ancestral hall, it was very rare.In normal times, Hogg’s request for lei was ‘rigid,’ and Hogg’s pursuit of perfection was no matter where it was.Do not allow LEI a mistake"Yes, FatherLei calm said“There are three major hazards in the entire Magnolia continent: the first mountain range, the “Warcraft Mountains”, the second mountain range, the “Sunset Mountains,” and the first forest, “The Forest of Darkness.”The three insurance areas cover a wide range of areasOne of the Warcraft Mountains from the nearly through the continent north and south, the entire World of Warcraft has thousands of miles long, there are countless World of Warcraft, and even have a sacred domain of ‘destroyed’ power of WarcraftThe entire continent also formed a different pattern because of this World of Warcraft.""West of Warcraft, a total of 12 kingdoms, 32 dugongsIn many kingdoms and principalities west of the Mountain of WarcraftMainly divided into two factionsOne is the sacred alliance headed by Kingdom of FinlandOne is the dark alliance led by the black lion kingdom, the sacred alliance and the dark alliance, because one side belongs to the 'holy church of the Holy See' and one belongs to the 'dark holy church', so they are constantly fighting with each other."" And the eastern mountains of Warcraft, but it has four major empire, the six kingdoms and many other countries! The four largest empires are the most massive and are not affected by the Holy See and the Dark Holy See.In the four great empires, imperial power is the most nobleAny of the four empire can be compared with the sacred alliance"The "four empirees are the Magnolia Empire in the center, the 'Rhine Empire' in the southeast, the 'Roo Empire' in the east, and the 'Oblarian Empire' in the north."Lei said it in one breath, but also breathed a sigh of relief"What about these?" Hogg's face was coldLei would immediately continue to say, but Hogg directly said: "I ask you, our sacred alliance has a total of several kingdoms, several principalities?" "Our sacred alliance has six kingdoms, ten, ten ... ..." lei suddenly Brows wrinkledHow many duchies are there in the Holy League? Lei's heart is a bit vague, it seems that it is fifteen dukes and it seems to be seventeen kingdomsFor a time, lei could not determine"Humph"Hogg's face was cold and he took a Vitex from the side, and lei threw out his right handHogg's eye muscles twitched. The Vitex in his hand was slamming and it was actually on LEI's right hand.Lei immediately appeared on the palm of his right hand a blood mark, lei just hold back his teeth, no sound"LEI, you have to remember that we are living in a sacred alliance and we must know the sacred alliance best!" Hogge looked at his son indifferently. "The entire Magnolia continent, probably the most important thing about the six major forcesFour empire and two major leagues! Lei noddedAlthough my father said it was simple, it also made it easy for people to understand"The sacred league borders the 'O'Brien Empire' in the extreme north position.The Dark Alliance is at the junction with the Magnolia Empire in the south.Our sacred alliance is under the leadership of the "Bright Holy See" and the level of solidarity is not weaker than the four major empire.Lei listened to what his father said.Yesterday, he also read a lot of books. Obviously, the Holy Alliance should be regarded as the ‘art center’ of the entire Magnolia continent.At the same time the sacred alliance economy, in the entire Magnolia continentIt is also comparable to the 'Magnolia Empire', which is the economic power.Plus the light of the Holy See behindHoly Alliance is indeed very powerful"Today, we study art“Hogger said coldly.” As an aristocrat, he must master art, art, and cultivate an aristocrat's inner temperament! Then Hoge took out a book with a fist full of strength and turned it over.“In the Magnolia calendar 3578, the great master of the Prouks stone was born in...” Hogge rigorously educated, and lei was working hard to understand the memory, trying to meet his father’s request.
