In the secluded mansion, only Yale, George, Renault, and a dozen maids, plus dozens of guardsThese people are mainly for leiUnder the trellis, Yale, George, and Renault are surrounded by stone tables."Yale boss, you said, what happened to his third child?" Renault's face was puzzled and he said helplessly.Yale shook his head. "I don't know either. The third child has been here for ten days. In the past ten days, the third child has no past **, no practice, and no joke with us."Always alone"George nodded:" Regardless of what happened in the past, the third year of cultivation will not stop.But now, he seems to have completely changed himself"" Who can tell me, what happened to the youngest? Renault's teeth are anxious"If I knew it would be fineYale reluctantly sighsThe most distressing of their three brothers is that they don’t even know why lei became like this, they didn’t cultivate, they didn’t play with them.It's always like being alone, it's like losing your soulBecome like this for no reasonAs a good lei brother, how can they not worry? "The youngest, certainly a great blowYale sighed with a low voice. George and Renault did not say anything at a glance. They couldn't help but remember the scene that they saw ten days ago. Thousands of people watched and the central radius was several hundred meters. Ground floor ruinsIn the rubble there are six deep pits and rocksThe full-bodied lei cried after sitting down on the ground after brutally killing the six purple robe deacons.It's like crying like a child“I’ve never seen a young man so sad, so fragile" Yale whisperedGeorge also nodded: "The youngest is very strong, that is, when I first broke up with Alice, the youngest is to directly enter the World of Warcraft Mountains after completing the dream of stone carving."" Well, his father is deadThe youngest also came upBut this time..." Renault was full of puzzlementThey are all pretty sureTheir good brothers are very fragile at the moment, but they can't find a reasonThis quiet house is next to the turbulent water in the backyard. LEI sits on a smooth stone in a decorative land, so that watching the stream flowing is motionlessBabe also stands on a smooth stone, leaning against the side of leiSilence, only the sound of currentsAlthough lei looked at the water, he remembered scenes from the past with Grandpa Delrin.Childhood and the Folly of Grandpa DelinJuvenile Age, Dr. Delin's Severe SupervisionIn the Mountain of Warcraft, Grandpa Delrin takes the trouble of reminding him again and againEvery scene recalls, lei feels a quiet moment of the soul"My father is deadI thought I was alone, but I don’t know. Actually I’ve always been very happy, no matter whatGrandpa Delrin supports me behind, comforts me, inspires me, reminds me..." "But why didn't I realize it in the past?Why didn't you cherish the days with Grandpa Delin? Lei heart pain is veryGrandpa Delin never asks himself excessivelyBut he never thought about Grandpa Delin, and he never cherished the time with Grandpa Delin.Perhaps in the subconscious, he thinks that Grandpa Delrin will always stay in the ring of dragons."Popular Ring? Grandpa Delrin stays in the Dragon Ring, always a lonely personIt would be painful to be alone in a place. Grandpa Delin actually wants me to chat with him.Lei only think of this timeHowever... In the past, lei would ask Grandpa Delrin unless he had any problems, but he rarely chatted with Grandpa Delrin himself.Only know to get, do not know to give"Why does it only know that you have to cherish when you lose?Lei body shivered slightlyHow much he expects Grandpa Delrin to come back againStay with him againUnfortunately... impossibleGrandpa Delin is dead and will die foreverLei feels his heart twitching, as if lickingFull body pain twitchingHowever, Lin Lei did not have the slightest painful expression on her face.Even in the heart of lei, there is a kind of idea - if it is so painful, it will be easy to escape."The boss"bebe's voice sounded in lei's mind, lei turned to look to beside bebe, bebe na putily look at lei, eyes contain fear"You, are you thinking about that Grandpa Delrin?" Bebe was also at the death of Deling Kewater, only to know that there was a sacred field where the sacred souls of Magi existed.Lei noddedBabe soul voice said: "Boss, you can, can you tell me about that Delrin Grandpa thing?" Watching Bebe, lei nodded slightly, and then hug bebe in her armsMemories began to talk about what happened to Grandpa Delin: "That year, I was eight years old.At that time, two strong sacred people appeared in our town of Wushan..." Renault three appeared in the courtyard of the backyard and quietly looked at the lei that was sitting on the smooth stones holding Beibei."When I saw the third child, I was very uncomfortableRenault sighed in silenceYale and George are also silent"We must find ways"George's eyes suddenly sharpened." Anyway, we can't let the youngster go so quiet."Yale and Renault both nodded"What do you have, second child?" Yale and Renault both look forward to seeing George.George said: "We don't even know why the third child will become this way.However, we can infer some"George said," His third family is the Dragon Blood Warrior family. As a family who once had a glorious history, his family certainly wants to recreate the glory of the family."<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Yale's eyes lighted: "Yes, the third child is very important to the family, once for the inheritance of his family." The Treasure SwordHe even auctioned off the dream awakening stone sculpture""now it's right"George nodded." According to my calculations, the youngest can practice so hard, surely there is a reason to encourage him to do so.And it's probably the reason to reproduce family gloryAs the youngster has worked hard for so many years, he will certainly not give up easily. We use this to motivate him.""excitation? is that useful? Yale has some doubtsGeorge reluctantly said: "But we still have a better way?" "On this method"Renault whispered." This is always the third and I can't stand it anymore.Go, let's three go and talk about himSee what happened to him in the end"" The fourthLet the second child say that you only say worseYale scoldsRenault also knew his character and noddedGeorge, Yale and Renault all looked at each other and walked towards lei.Bebe listens to the narration of leiAlso silentHe was also very sad and saddened by the death of Dill Cowater.Suddenly Bebe felt that someone was behind him and he jumped out of the arms of lei and looked back.It was Yale, George, and Renault.However, at the moment, lei had just talked about Delin’s grandfather’s affairs. However, he completely immersed himself in memories and did not feel the arrival of others.Yale, George, and Renault all looked at each other and sighed.Lei is a master, if under normal circumstances, yalu three probably in the backyard door lei felt, but now these three people have come to lei behindLei did not respond"The thirdYale opened the wayLei body shockedThen he turned his head slightly and looked at the three people. His eyes were calm: "You have come."said lei turned again and continued to watch the streamYale, George, Renault three immediately went to the side of the rock"The thirdYale suddenly seizes the lei shouldersLet lei's eyes look at him. "The youngest, you remember what happened at Ernst Magic School. How do you usually tell me?" "Forgot?” lei flat roadYale said: "Forgot? Third, you often attack me and say that I don't work hard to practice. I'm afraid that the highest strength of my dormitory becomes the weakest one."In the past, four brothers were naturally joking in a dormitory.Lei is still silentGeorge looked at Yale and nodded slightly. Yale let go of lei's shoulders. And George walked to the lei ground and solemnly said: "I want to ask you, my third child. What are you trying hard to cultivate for so many years?" LEI YiyiIn his mind, he can't remember from childhood to childhood, and practice hard every day."For the familyLei finally answeredNext to the Yale and Renault, there was a glimmer of joy in his eyes. George immediately pursued the victory: “Then I ask you, now you are like this, can you afford your family?” lei looked at George and smiled, Xiao Xiao cable said: “My father is dead, mother Dead, you said, what is the use of my family efforts?" lei stood up and walked toward the courtyard doorYale, George, and Renault looked at lei's back and looked at each other"Useless, are dead, what do I desperately do?"

"Looking at the youngest, a silent appearance, I am really worried and sad.This is the third year, uh ..." Yale grabbed the bottle and poured it directly into the mouth. He drank half a bottle of wine.They grew up with lei, mutual feelings are more like brothers, how can they look at lei so indifferent? Sitting in a chair beside his room, lei watched the hands of the dragon ringLei clearly remembers the scene of Grandpa Delrin's coming out of the dragon ring again and againThat scene can never be seen againLei actually wears a space ring on the index finger of the other hand. After Clyde's death, this space ring is already a thing of no use.In the fight with the six special deacons, the blood on the body of LEI has long been reddish this space ring.Naturally recognizing the LordBut ... ... this fifteen days, lei did not see a look at this space ringHis mind is not on thisEven if he does not want to, but his mind is always full of scenes with Grandpa Delin, the appearance of Grandpa Delrin, the teaching of Grand Prix of Delrin ... ... clearly remember all kinds of scenes"Why, why, even the last grandfather of Delin is dead?” Losing Grandpa Delrin, Lin Li lost his strongest reliance, and at this time he was fragile and lonely.Lei tightly hold the baby, just alone in this quiet room to stay so ... ...
