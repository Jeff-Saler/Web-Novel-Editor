His face was full of gratitude. “Dawson adults, you want to see me. When people say it, I go straight to you."This Vicente really appreciates Monroe & Dawson."Monroe & Dawson have been very friendly and courteous to their Hyde family for the last half year.And there are no requirementsIn particular, this time, if you don’t have the help of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce in the Han Mu Kingdom, I’m afraid that the Hyde family’s death will be more"Haha, first come to the roomMonroe & Dawson warmly beat Vicente's shoulder"it is good“Vicente of the Hyde family, Vicente’s father, and Vicente’s two sons are all out."Mr. Vicente, come, let me introduce you to you.“Monroe & Dawson said with a smile and pointed at lei.” My son, the three of them, you know, and this is the genius wizard I used to say to you.

You should know it."Vicente's eyes have special feelings, whether it is the Hyde family.Still the Baruch family, although they have all decayedBut their bones are proudThe four ultimate fighter families with a long family of more than 5,000 years of historyThis kind of bone is proud, even if it is declining, but their heart is proud.See the children of the two ultimate fightersIt really has a special feeling"Purple Flame Warrior FamilyLei said directly humility“I have a detailed account of the Hyde family in the Baruch family inheritance book for the same family of ultimate fighters."Vicente heard this, could not help but feel very face, see lei is also more pleasing to the eye"LEI, let me introduce youThis is my oldest son, comet & Hyde, this is my youngest son, Trey & Hyde."Vicente is obviously very satisfied with his son," lei, my two sons talent is also very goodBut compared to you, there is still a big gap"The comets and Trey, but they nodded their heads, but they couldn't obviously convince their father that his brother was worse than Lin.“HahaWell, Mr. VicenteToday, I'm here to help you with a favorMonroe & Dawson said directlyVicente immediately said with pride: "Dawson adults have something to say despiteI can only do itWill try to do it"This half a year, the Dawson Chamber of Commerce has helped the Hyde family do a lot of thingsHowever, he did not report a kindness to the Hyde family.After all, the Dawson Chamber of Commerce needs to ask him to do one thing.Owing to people's kindness, the taste is not good.Monroe & Dawson leaned and pointed at lei: "lei he wants a weapon, he wants to ask you to refine it for him.""Refining weapons? "Vicente looked to lei, asked," lei, is your own? "" It isLei noddedIn the eyes of Vicente, he was also relieved and nodded. “Yes, how can we be weak in the children of our ultimate fighter family? We must cultivate our warrior abilities and we must have a good weapon.Say, what are your requirements for weapons? "Whether Vicente or his two sonsWhen you know that lei is a magic genius, the heart is still a bit of a grudge, because in their view, the four ultimate fighter families, it should be a powerful warriorNow that LEI wants them to help make a weapon, they are somewhat happy"A heavy swordLei said slowly, "Mr. Vicente, I'm now one meter nine in height, and the length of the epee is set by you."You should know what length of epee fits my height"Vicente has some doubts:" is the epee, not a giant sword? "Fighting knife with epee, it is two categories"It is epeeLei confirmed the road"Well, are there any other requirements?" Vicente is the patriarch of the Purple Warrior family. The children of the Purple Warrior family are not only powerful warriors but also good at refining weapons.Lei took out the parcel behind: "I think that this epee material must have itLei removed the palm-sized black stone from the parcelFrom the surface alone, Vicente couldn't see that the black stone was obsidian in front of him. After all, Vicente had never seen obsidian in his whole life. Immediately he wondered: "What is this stone called?" "Black obsidianLei directly answered" Obsidian?" Vicente, including Vicente's father, two sons are shocked to see the slap size black stones in the hands of leiVicente stunned his heart and looked at lei: "Can you show it to me?""canVicente took the Obsidian carefully. Although he hadn't seen obsidian, Vicente knew that Obsidian was very heavy. He was also prepared.Sure enough... "There's a thousand kilograms"Vicente's eyes light up." Sure enough, this obsidian is nearly a hundred times bigger than gold, and it really is true."Vicente suddenly reacted, shocked to see lei said:" lei, do you want this whole obsidian into the epee? "Yes, allLei repliedVicente shook his head and said: "LEI Lei, this obsidian has more than a thousand kilos, obsidian-basedOther ore materials must not be worseWith the size of your epee, the final refining will be successful.The epee is estimated to be nearly three thousand pounds, ah, three pounds of epee, I'm the first time refining, such a heavy swordDo you want to use it yourself? It is the general seven-level fighters who are not used to it.While the eighth-level fighters, although able to easily swingHowever, speed will also be affected"<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "Mr. Vicente, you just make it."Lei said with a smileDragon Blood Warrior, powerful is **The dragon blood grudge, but to be weakerAmong the four ultimate fightersDragon Blood Warrior and Undead Warrior should belong to the kind of powerful force.Baruch, the first generation chief of the Baruch family, dared to face the Sanctuary of the World of Warcraft, the Hydra, and eventually killed the Hydra King.Hydra King, that volume is incredibly big, naturally, needless to say, the strength is regarded as the best in Sanctuary of Warcraft.Can still be strangled and killed by Baruch's front, which can be found in the dragon bloody warrior's powerful, overbearing place Vicente looked at lei more than one, and ultimately nodded his head: "My familyThere is a recipe for the combination of obsidian, but other precious oresI can hardly raise it for a time"" This is handed to meMonroe & Dawson said arbitrarilyWiesen nodded and raised some ores with the power of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce.Vicente looks to leiZheng Zhongdao: "LeiObsidian weapons are good if you just do a little bit of obsidian powderI still have a way to open up for this epee, but you use so many obsidian, I am afraid that I can make this edge of the epee thinner, but it is impossible to open it up."A thousand kilograms of obsidian were used for refining. Vicente had never heard such a large handwriting.The weapon was refined and it was determined to be tough and strong and terrible. To start it up, Vicente was still self-knowledgeable."Can't open the front?" Lin Lei brow slightly wrinkledLei suddenly thought of his family's book records, the first generation of dragon blood warriors were using a sword to slaughter, but later the dragon blood warrior is not, there is also a dragon blood warrior using a hammerThe weight hammer rests on the weightThree kilograms of heavy epee, completely caught up with the ancestors and weighed heavily."If you do not open the front, you will not open the front."lei is confident, so heavy to the heavy epee, relying on the power of dragon terror warrior wandering in the body of Warcraft, I am afraid that Warcraft will be strangled"Well, as long as the ore is raised, I can immediately refine it for you. A weapon is enough for half a day."Vicente said confidently that he was also refining a lot of weapons, and he was also confident of the family's refining and secret law."Monroe & Dawson smiled and said: "Vicente, then you are not happy to give me your so-called secret recipe?" "OK, I'll take thisVicente is also vigorous and resoluteThe Dawson Chamber of Commerce was terribly inefficient, and before dark it required a variety of ores that had been preparedIn fact, the recipe of the Hyde family doesn’t insist on which kinds of materials are necessary. Each kind of material has alternative ores.The materials provided by Dawson Chamber of Commerce are all the best and the quantity is also sufficientThat night"The material quality is very good, and they are all excellent ores"Vicente looked at the ore, and his face was red, and he laughed." lei, these materials are so good. I'm afraid that the refined epee is slightly heavier than I expected."" NothingLei smiledIt's just a little heavier than three thousand pounds. Generally, the nine-level warriors can be easily waved, not to mention the amazing dragon blood warriors."Okay, I'll start the morning tomorrow morning.Vicente said boldlyLei did not return to his apartment that evening, but only with the sound of beibei voice confessedBabe is also very clever and stays in the courtyard with peace of mindFor Bebe, you can eat, sleep and eat. Life is very good.In the early morning, Tian Gang Meng MengliangThe three sons and daughters of the Hyde family have squatted and started exercising.The three sons and daughters of this father and son are Vicente, and the comets and the Trey are assisting in the side. The bellows are also pulled. The flame temperature is also strikingly high.“Vicent Vicente’s body surface has a blue flame, and the blue flame has melted into the original fire. Even if the color of the fire has changed, those other ore materials are beginning to melt. Only meteorites are the slightest. Change does notVicente lifted a glass of green concoction from the side and poured it directly on the obsidian. “The green concoction actually had some special changes on the obsidian surface. Obsidian was actually under the scorching heat. Slowly began to meltThe final sword rough embryo into"Oh!" "Oh!" "Oh!" ... The big hammer squats again and again, and the speed is at an alarming rate.Vicente wields a hammer, but gives the crowd an artistic enjoymentObviously, Vicente's hammer hammer has special rules, and the whole shape of the epee is more clear"Vicente's body also keeps popping out of the blue flame, making the epee continue to burn.This continuous strike for three hours, the surface color of the heavy epee changed from the original messy color to dark color, Vicente was also full of sweat, his face was a little paleThis time, refining the heavy sword is probably the most tired one."To come to Castle Peak SpringVicente shoutedHis oldest son, Comet, immediately came in with a bucket of water from the side, and at the same time poured a small cup of liquid that had been put together from this bucket of water.With the family secret recipe liquid to melt the cleanest Qingshan spring water, this quenching agent is definitely the best"嗤嗤 Heavy sword ** quenching agentNext to the eyes of lei, Monroe & Dawson, they all light up. After the quenching agent, the epee is almost the same.However, at this time, the gloomy sky suddenly sounded a deep thunder.But people on the field don’t care"Vicente succeeded in pulling out this epee. His face was full of excitement. He exalted himself and laughed." Haha, lei, success, this is my most perfect work in my life! "" Rush card! A horror sounded, and a sharp blue thunder in the sky was suddenly under the turbulence. It was actually bombarded directly above this epee.
