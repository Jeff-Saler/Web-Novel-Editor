"Decided adults"Gilmer saw that lei was so disrespectful, and he immediately confessed to ‘fallen leaves’"Lithuan adults, this lei is only 17 years old this yearHope that deciduous adults can forgive his disrespectGilmer clearly understood the influence of ‘fallen leaves’ in the light of the Holy See. The fallen man can be considered as spiritual leader of the cultivator and is the bright pope.It is also impossible to force the order to do what the fallen leaves doThe deciduous, right-handed, wrinkled skin like a chicken paw gently touches his messy beard.Looked away with interest to lei: "Impossible?

Gilmer was a bit confused. Since he admired the other why he wouldn't want to guide him again? The leaves shook his head and said: "My way of cultivation is not suitable for him. The path I take is the need for pure heart.Aiming for the bright people to practice, and he ... ... to go, it should be the road to killingGilmer noddedGilmerYou don't have to choose a teacher for him. Really strong.It is on their own understanding that they have come out of their own path and taught it to others.Always understood by others"Looking down to Gilmer," you are now a nine-level wizard.But why didn't I keep guiding you? That's the reason.Even if I tell you, I will understand and feelYou still can't succeed, because only if you can experience and change your mind again and again and realize the deepest mysteries, you will be able to succeed.""rememberOn their own"The fallen leaves said with a smileGilmer noddedHe did not step into the sanctuaryCan't understand the difference between the sanctuary and the ninth level, although he sometimes wonders if ‘fallen leaves’ are deliberatelyBut at the moment, the leaves are sincerely looking and soundingMake him believe in the fallen leaves"Perhaps really relying on myself"Gilmer stayed at the Nine Classes Wizard for a long time.He also desires to break throughAfter all, Grade 9 and SanctuaryThat is the difference between land and heaven and earthLei Rai Prefecture, Spring ParkIn the pool next to the hot springs, lei is sitting still and cross-legged."汩汩 汩汩 ~" lei inside the body constantly heard a variety of strange sound, lei bones and muscles are constantly writhing tremorsSweat permeates slowly through every pore in the bodyPractice "Dragon Blood Code", the effect is more than ten times better than the general vindictive code."Dragon Blood Code" practice requirements are so harshThere is such an effect"Human cultivationWhy are you so troublesome?Also divided into different physique?"
