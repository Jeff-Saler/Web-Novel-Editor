In the city of Fenlay City, Alice is on the balcony of her two-story small building with his hands propped up to watch the pedestrians in front of the street.Since lei left last time, Alice watched pedestrians on the balcony almost every day, hoping that lei would come again.However..."Tomorrow will begin, and today will go."Alice sighed in her heart and finally looked at the street."She just expects lei to come and see her again. It's a pity that lei hasn't been there once in ten days. At this time, the sound of a good friend Niya screams in the doorway below. “Alice, hurry."Niya, Tony, Ka Lan are waiting at the doorKalan, Niya, and Tony were three of the Warriors’ Institutes. Their three-person college was close to Alice’s Willing School of Magic.Plus all four people are in the city of Finlay, so the relationship is also good"Okay, I'll be down"Alice looked at the street in front of the mansion, and the parcels on her back went downstairs."...... On the third evening of Alice’s departure from the city of Finlay, lei came to the front of Alice's yard and looked up at the balcony of the two-story building, but there was no one on the balcony."Hey, what did you do?" Alice's middle-aged man shouted at Lin.Lei turned to look, smiled and inquired: "Hello, I'm Wei Lin School of Magic, and Alice is a good friendDidn't she know Alice is still home now? ""Oh"The middle-aged man said with a smile," Miss Alice has left home for three days, and she has long been to the Magic Academy."" I know, thank youLei said politelyLei turned and walked along the street, just walked to the end of dry street, still looking back at the balcony of the second floor, with a hint of helplessness******* To the streets of Ernst CollegeA white streamer flies out of the Panlong Ring and turns into a white moon robe with white hair and white hair.Deling Kewater looked at lei with a smile: "Lea, like Alice?" "A bit" lei does not denyDeling Kewater touched the white beard and laughed, "I didn't realize that you kid was finally tempted by the woman. However, lei, you and that Alice are in different magic colleges. The two are separated in the two places. What kind of emotional progress you want, but it's difficult.""I know, if you go, there will be results, not thatLei couldn't help but emerge with Alice's sceneThere was a panic under the bloodthirsty warfare for the first timeThere was a shy look from the two when she was talking back from the Mountain of Warcraft.In the moonlight, it looks like a moonlight fairy.... "This is the first love?Lei ridiculed a smile, to his age, in the quarters when the four brothers often talk about some girls, even Yale and Renault already had a girlfriendFor feelings, lei also has a point of expectation****** At Ernst School of Enchanted Learning, lei practiced as seriously as before, and spent part of its time every day on the carving of the genre of flat knife. Whether it was spiritual or magical, it was steadily rising.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> Instantly passed in JanuaryIn accordance with the old rules, four brothers, Lei Lei, and three stone carvings departed for the city of Finlay, in the room of Ostouni in the Prouks Hall in the City of Finlay."Near fifteen thousand gold coins? So much?" lei was a bit surprised at the price of the last three stone worksOstonyhaha laughed and said: "LEI, this is normalThe master stone master works, the price can reach 1,000 gold coinsWe at the Prouks Hall focused on your identity. A stone carving work created by a fifteen-year-old magic genius can only double the price of this stone work because of your identity alone."The most important thing is... Your stone carving works are very strange. Other people's stone carving works are beautiful, but there are certain flaws in the degree of fluidity."Your artwork is very smooth. For example, if you use a flat knife and a jade bowl knife, you can't notice the break marks. The connection is very perfect.Lei could not help but laughBreak marks? The stone sculptures of his flat knife school use only a flat knife from beginning to end. There is no need to use various carving knives. Natural lines will be perfect.“Because of this particular point, plus the aloof temperament in your work itself, plus your identity, the price of the work reached nearly 5,000 gold coins.It is only slightly lacking in the handling of some fine lines, otherwise the price may be higher"Ostoni praisedLei also understand"Detailed markings processing?" lei secretly shaking his head in mind, his use is a flat knife, although barely able to get out some other special lines, but on the effect, surely than oblique knife, round knife and other professional carving knife effect is weak someAt the same time, Lin Lei also lamentedThree stone works can be sold for 15,000 gold coinsThis money is too easy to come byIf LEI is fully cared for carving, ten works can be carved in one month.Ten works, the value is nearly 50,000 gold coins! “I’ve been in the mountains of Warcraft for two months, experienced several death and death crises, and added some killers to get 70,000 gold coins. Stone masters are simply stealing money.Lei sighedThe price of lei's works is also among the highest among stone masters."The master stone carving can be considered to steal money, then the master stone carving ... ..." lei heart lamentedThe more in-depth understanding, the more sigh LEIStone carving, the income gap is too obviousThe sacred allied stone master is also about 100The scarcity of numbers can be imagined"lei, hard work, I believe you will become a great master of stone carving"Ostoni encouraged the roadMaster stone sculpture not only has amazing wealth, but also has a very high status.They are standing at the pinnacle of this most ancient art, that is, the general aristocracy met them and did not dare to be proudGrandmaster! This is a very bad nameThat's not what money and rights can get. It's someone who can get to the top in a certain industry and get everyone's recognition.
