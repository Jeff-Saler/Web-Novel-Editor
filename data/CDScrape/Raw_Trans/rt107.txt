Among the Buss family's garden, Alice is sitting in a ceremony with Karan.Alice"Ka Lan's face is full of excited smiles." I have already talked with my father. The date of our engagement is set on June 18, and the day of our wedding is January 1, next year. Is the day of 'Magnolia Festival' next year"Alice smiled on her face, too."Next year, isn't the 10,000 calendar of the Magnolia calendar next year? Holding our wedding at the Magnolia Festival for 10,000 years in the Yulan calendar is really... too wonderful!Alice said, laughing a little happily.Looking at Alice's happy smile, Kalan was satisfied"Alice, talk to your father as soon as possible and give me the list of guests from your side, so that I can arrange it as soon as possible.Card Blue urged"YepAlice nodded softlyKalan touches Alice's hair, and her heart is satisfiedBut at the thought of the plight of the family now, Ka Lan has some anxiety.Not long after he had walked with Alice, the Debuss family had an unprecedented blow - the Dawson Chamber of Commerce abandoned it! The Debuss family can have today's glory and is inseparable from the Dawson Chamber of Commerce.However, in December last year, the Dawson Chamber of Commerce directly announced the withdrawal of cooperation with the Debuss family, and transferred various businesses in the Kingdom of Finlay to another family in the kingdom of Finlay, replacing another family with the Debus family. s positionAnd... not only that, the Dawson Chamber of Commerce even suppressed the Debuss family, making the Debus Group’s businesses lose money in succession."This road forest chamber of commerce, how could we oppress my family? We did not get the Dawson Chamber of Commerce."Card blue is also very annoyed. As the family's future successor, Karan naturally pays attention to this.Because it happened after he told Alice and his family that he had just told the family that many people in the family now think that 'Alice' is a disaster.Otherwise, why did the Dawson Chamber of Commerce that has cooperated for so many years abandoned them? Thankfully for so many yearsThe Debuss family has accumulated huge wealth. Although the loss is huge, the Debus family still has at leastBut the Debuss family also understood that because of unclear reasons, the Dawson Chamber of Commerce’s suppression caused them to have no hope in the ‘commercial’ family.No one would be willing to offend them for this one super giant of the Mori Chamber of CommerceSo, they could only find another way out of the Debuss family.After shaking his head and throwing these troubles behind his head, Karan smiled and looked at Alice: "Alice, I heard that the Pruxx Hall yesterday exhibited a very rare stone sculpture. It is said that Comparable to those masters worksMany people look at it. Are we going to see it? "Alice also feels bored:"****** Card Blue and Alice ride on the carriageGoing to the Plucks Hall"This stone sculpture is said to be very good. I've been busy preparing various things about our engagement and big wedding for two days.Did not have time to take you to see"Karl Blue first jumped out of the carriage, and then very gentleman took Alice's hand to bring her downAlice and Kalan went side by side into the Prussian Pavilion."You see, Karan's brother, there are so many people."Alice eyes pointing forwardPeople crowded in the ‘master’s hall’, the deepest place in the Plucks HallHowever, in the ‘Master Showroom’ it was very orderly, from one door to go out from another doorEveryone is only allowed to stay for about three minutesEvery three minutes, viewers in the master hall must leaveWant to go in and see again ... line, again in line! "Good team"Ka Lan also surprised in the heart, so many years he has not seen the Plucks Hall so people pass by.Kalan and Alice also followed the rules and they both had a full 20 minutes.It was their turn to enter the master exhibition hall.This group of people enters the master exhibition hall.Go one after another toward the frontThe curious Chinese Alice and Karan naturally rushed to the frontBut when Alice first saw the appearance of the stone sculptureThe whole person seemed to be settled and looked at the giant stone sculpture in front of him.The beautiful five women stone carvings, each woman sculpture contains a special tasteOthers are immersed in the implication of the ‘Awakening’ stone sculpture.But Alice saw this stone sculpture, but in her mind he couldn't help but recall the scenes of his past with lei. For the first time in desperation, Lin Lei was like a god.There was a scene where the two chatted for a night under the balcony... scenes surfaced, making Alice totally stupidShe really didn't think of attracting so many people. The ‘sculpture’ that had reached the master’s level turned out to be itself blue.“Lin, lei...” Alice’s mood suddenly went to the extremeShe looked to the side close to the introduction - "This stone carving author," lei, 17 years old this year, graduated from Ernst Magic School, such as this year's seventeen-year-old lei is already seven double magician, He is now the absolute first magic genius on the entire Magnolia continent. Even in the tens of thousands of years of history of Magnolia mainland, lei is also the second magic genius in history."However, lei has not only achieved such success in the field of magic, but has made even greater achievements in the field of stone sculpture. After 17 years of age, this "wake up dream" stone sculpture..."... A word will completely give Alice Shocked"It is Lin Lei, it is lei"Alice looked at it with a slight look," seven-level double magician? He is already a seven-level double magician? Yes, but last year he was just <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Mage's"Alice does not know, before breaking up with her, lei is already a six-level double magicianOnly lei had never had a chance to tell her“Wake up, this stone carving is called 'wake up'"Alice looked at the five humanoid sculptures of the stone sculpture, especially the last sculpture that contained feelings of desperation. She suddenly understood the real meaning of lei's name of this stone carving as 'a dream awakening'.""Dream, wake up?" Alice felt that her head was messyFor the first man she really likes, Alice always has a lei's position in her heart.However, when she discovered that lei named the stone carving as "wake up," she suddenly felt as if she had lost something in her heart.- That feeling is hard to acceptAlice suddenly noticed that the blue card next to the blue, Ka Lan's face is extremely ugly, the two fists are tightly gripped, green veins suddenly gloomy, gloomy faceIn the eyes, there is an unclear light, and I stare at that stone sculpture"Card Blue BrotherAlice shouted with worryCard Blue simply ignores Alice"LEI, you, you are too much"In the heart of Kalan, there is endless anger.In the past, Karan's attitude towards lei was very good, but in the end, Karan was also somewhat scornful of lei.It seems to KaranIt was lei who worked hard alone and it was hard to compare with a familyAfter all, his family relied on the giant ship of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce.But how long is this? Only five monthsThe Debuss family was abandoned by the Dawson Chamber of CommerceWhat about lei? However, he turned into a seven-level double magician field at the age of seventeen.It is the first magic genius of the entire Magnolia mainland.In the history of Magnolia mainland recorded, only one person was slightly stronger than lei.“Only seventeen years old were seven-level double magicians, but they are still comparable to the masters of stone carving."Ka Lan felt a burst of powerThe other party is too goodBut immediatelyKaran is endless angerBecause the blueprint of this stone carving is his fiancee! "Well, you see, the woman who dreams of 'stone waking up' resembles this one?" 'Master Showroom' suddenly sounded a sound, and suddenly there were dozens of eyes looking at Alice and suddenly there was a sound of controversy. SoundedThe stone carving ability of Lin Lei is too strong and it has already fully played out the kind of charm.Those viewers saw Alice’s first lookThere is a feeling...the girl in front of youLike a woman in the ‘waking up’ stone sculptureIt can be regarded as a person, that unique eyeThat is slightly sharp nose"Miss, dare to ask you what is the relationship with the master lei?" a hair is a little gray, now is more than a hundred years old to ask Alice courteouslyAmong the stone carving skills, the master is the masterThe art of lei has made these collectors who have studied stone carving for more than 100 years admiredlyCalling it a ‘master’ is also from the heartThe old man studied the vision of stone carving over a hundred years, naturally guessed that the woman in the stone carving may have a confusing feeling with the lei master.Alice was awkward and could not help but look to the side of the card blue"Oh, Karan, you are also"The old man looks at Ka Lan and is old. He naturally sees the relationship between Ka Lan and Alice." Ka Lan, who is this lady? "Although Cardin was dissatisfied with the bottom of my heart, I was still humbly cursing:" Lord Duke of Berner, this is Miss Alice, my fiancee.""fiancée? “The Duke of Bernard thoughtfully glanced at Cardin and Alice, and smiled and said nothing.****** Card Blue pulls Alice and quickly escapes as fast as he can escape to the Debus House.The chief of the Debuss family, Karan's father Leonard, was looking at his son in disbelief: "What did you say? The blueprint of the piece that was exhibited in the Prussium is Alice? Bernard still prefers his son'sWhen his son said that he wanted to marry Alice, Bernard did not deny it.But only a few days after the relationship between his son and Alice was confirmed, the Dawson Chamber of Commerce abandoned the Debus family for no reason.For this, Bernard sought to see the upper class of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce and seek to meet.Bernard has been busy with this matter for the past few monthsEven the exhibition at the Plucks Hall was exhibited yesterday. Today he was too lazy to pass.“Alice, is Alice in the first place?” Bernard’s face was hard to seeKalan nodded: "Yes, father.Today, I have not been engaged to Alice. However, once engaged, Alice is known to a large number of nobles in Shengdu. The lei's stone work, ‘Wake up’, will definitely be the biggest joke of our family.Bernard pondered for a moment and frowned and looked at Card Blue and asked, "Is it serious? Is there anything unsightly about this stone carving? "Father, there was a period between lei and Alice..." card blue said vaguely. "And that piece of stonework is about him and Alice."Bernard no longer speaks, but his brows wrinkledAfter a few moments, Bernard looked at Karan: "Kalan, if I let you give up Alice, would you?" Karan shook his head resolutely, after all, he was only eighteen this year.Bernard nodded slightly: "Alice, don't worry, I'll solve this matter. You don't care."Card blue nodded, suddenly Karan a bite and looked to his father and said:" Father, I was with Alice, that lei is certainly very unhappy with me, and now the potential of lei is too great, I think ... ... Can we think of ways to kill lei? ”
