Melit closed the door to the study, and when she heard Alice's words, she could not help but turn and smiled and looked at Alice: "Miss Alice, you and I can't talk upright about the Debus family. If I was known by His Majesty the King, then I would be unluckyYou have to know, I'm at risk for your Debuss family, it's still better to close the doorAlice gave a glimpse ofOn speaking, how could Alice catch up with Merritt, the right-winger who had been mingled on officialdom for so long? Merritt smiled and walked toward the side. There was a round table and two chairs in front of the bookshelf. The usual Merritt would talk to some friends here.Merritt sat down first and then looked at Alice: "Alice, you sit down too.""Thank you, Lord Merritt.Alice breathed a sigh of relief and sat down in another chair. Alice was actually the most vigilant to the bed in the study."Please wait"Merritt smiled and got up, and then took out a bottle of red wine and two glasses from under the desk, and after Alice had fallen with him for half a cup,"Alice, this is sixty years of wine in the blue rain of the Magnolia Empire. It tastes good. You taste it.Merritt smiled and raisedAlice is a bit worried about whether this drug is like a drug or something likeFaced with Myrtle’s gaze, Alice had to lift her glass and touch her lips.Merritt was not forced to change the subject and said: "Alice, you are engaged to Karan, and it is estimated that you know something about the Debus family.Do you know that their family is smuggling things? ""do not knowI think he can't smugglingAlice said quickly. "My dear, the Debus family is still strong. I don't think they will do smuggling.""Merritt looked at Alice like a smile:" It's hard to say""Hey! "Merritt seemed to see something and leaned forward to Alice.Even his face and Alice's face was only about ten centimeters awayAlice panicked and tried to duck"do not move"Merritt drank with a bit of command.Perpetually occupying a high position, Merritt’s words made Alice’s whole person stunned, but Alice felt cramped.Merritt looks at Alice's hair carefully, then looks down at Alice.This bow, Merritt and Alice's face, but also just a few centimeters awayThis caused Alice to move her head backSeeing this scene, Merritt smiledReturning to his position and sighing helplessly, said: "I just saw you have a white hair on the head, but unfortunately you movedI can't find it again"White hair? Alice could not help but irritableShe lived with Rowlin. When she gets up everyday and gets bored, she combs her hair and often finds white hair.Rowling also said she was envious of Alice and she could not find a gray hairRowling combed her hair every dayHow could this Merritt discover? It's just that Alice doesn't dare to say anything more"Alice, you are still young.Don't worry too much, the trouble will be oldThere will be white hair"Merritt said with careAlice just did not speak quietlyMerritt moved the chair towards AliceThen he gazed at Alice and said, "Alice, you look so beautiful.That beautiful temperament, really moving"Alice is a bit embarrassed, some crampedMerritt leaned forward again and continued to stare at Alice: "Alice, my wife only knows vain vanity, it seems so vulgar, but you are completely different from them.Really, you know? At the first sight of you, I was shocked by you."" I regret it and regret why those women were jealous"Merritt suddenly reached out and held Alice's hand, which made Alice round her eyes."Merritt continued to look at Alice. "Alice, if, if I told you, I fell in love with you from the bottom of my heart, and I loved you. Do you believe it?" Alice stood up quickly.But Merritt was holding Alice's hand tightly."Merritt, Lord Merritt, I'm Kalandi's fiancée!" Alice tried hard, two or three times before she pulled back from Meryl's hands.Melite smiled and looked at Alice: "It's just a fiancée. It shows that you haven't gotten married yet. You can marry another person. You know, Karan, a little boy, and you know what's funny?" Alice approached, Alice could not help but continue to recedeBut in the panic, Alice did not notice it. She was already forced by Merritt to just step out of bed."Alice, I really like you.I swear! Merritt looked lovingly at Alice.Merritt did not panic. After enjoying the ‘Awakening’ stone sculpture, he saw Alice himself. He really liked Alice.It's just like this, it's just possessiveness"Merritt!" Alice was in a panic.Suddenly the legs touched the edge of the bed and one of them was unsteady. The whole person couldn't help the smile on his face in the face of Yang Muite. Immediately, he stepped past Alice. The whole person was almost close to Alice: "Alice My goddess, satisfy my wish for this mortal obsessionSatisfying my desires, I will satisfy your desires so that the Debuss will wash their grievances."Scrutinize? Alice sees Merritt at the moment, and her mind can't help but emerge from the moment when she was with lei in a small hotel. When two people lingered to the most important moment, she stopped lei. ScenesHow can I give this person my own innocence? "My goddess, come on."Merritt's voice is soft and seems to be a hypnotist"No, no!" Alice yanked the dagger off his waist and stabbed directly at Merritt.At the same time, the stones on the ground also flew up towards Merritt.AliceAfter all, it is also a land magician! Camelot was also a fierce warrior. The whole person reacted very sensitively. His body flashed at the side, and at the same time, the dagger in Alice's hand was slapped.Alice immediately hid her side and wanted to run towards the doorMerritt's stature moves to the gateLooked at Alice like a laugh: "Alice, do you still want to rebel? With your magician strength, plus that dagger you want to rebel?" "Merritt adults, you let me go"Alice was a bit determined this time.""You don't want to save the Debuss family? Don't want to save your fiancé card blue?" Merritt askedAlice looked resolutely and gritted her teeth: "Even if I want to save, it's not like that. You and this beast!" "Beasts?" Merritt's face changed.Smirking, "I wanted to get something interesting, but you didn't cooperate.Then I'll show you the animals"Alice's face is not white.""Merritt, don't go too far"Alice panicked and leaned back and pulled the chair next to Merritt."Merritt easily smashed the chair with a punch"You do not revolt, hereIt's my house"Merritt said with a chuckleAlice looked at Merritt's step closer and said with a gritted tooth: "MerrittDo not forget, I used to be a lei woman! ! ! "This sentence made Merritt stunnedAlice really doesn't want to say thatShe knew that her original behavior had hurt lei.She does not want to have any connection with leiBut at this time, she had no other way<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "LEI?" Merritt stoodBrows wrinkledAlice bit her lip and looked at Merritt: "Merritt, I can't happen today, but if you go too far, you can't blame me for tearing my face. I believe you should know lei's Influential"Merritt looked at Alice in front of herHe was really obsessed with Alice in front of him, but Melet knew very well that the relationship between lei and Alice was very specialThe feeling of lei on Alice is felt from the stone carving of the "wake up dream" alone."Lee is really interested in this Alice. If she let lei know..." Merritt got a headache.LeiIt's hard to deal with! It is now the lei, the influence is already very strongHis Merritt was stronger, and it was only a kingdom right. For the Holy See, the removal of a king of the kingdom may require careful consideration, but it is not necessary to consider how to deal with a right kingdom of a kingdom.As long as lei asks the bright paladin to help him and deal with him, it is not difficult at all.In the future, I'm afraid that lei’s achievement is even higherThis is also the reason why the nobility of the entire kingdom of Finlay did not use lei as a toolThis also caused the eyes of the lei, the nobles are very polite to himEvery nobleman is so courteous"Hey..." Merritt sighed. "Alice, I really like you from the depths of my heart. I love my head."Merritt apologized to Alice. "I'm sorry. I'm sober now. If you don't feel like I'm feeling, then I won't force you."""My Melite, I'll go first"Alice quickly reached the door and opened the door and rushed out."Seeing Alice's departure, Meryl, who had apologized and apologized, looked sharply sharp. His face was covered with a layer of frost, and Lengheng cried, “Oh, stinky woman!”**** **When Alice returns to the Debus House, the sky is completely dark.At the moment the family of the Debus family gathered in the living room to enjoy dinnerOnly the atmosphere is not very good, after all, the family may be finished at any time"Alice, are you back?" suddenly Rowling saw Alice ran in from the doorNimitz and others stood up"How is it so fast?" Nimitz frownedAlice came back too fast, exceeding his estimate"Alice, let's have dinner togetherRoryn immediately called outAlice walked into the hallway of the living room and looked at the parlor person, apologetically saying: "I'm not feeling well, I'm going back to rest and the voice is low and hoarse.Rowling feels Alice’s tone is wrong"I went to see Alice."Raughlin smiled at the crowd, and he went out of the living room."Only Nimitz's brow furrowed... Alice and Rowling’s roomAs soon as Alice enters the room, she jumps directly onto the bedThe tears can no longer help but rush down, there are endless grievances in the heart"What did I do? Lord, why did you punish me so?" Alice muttered angrily in her heart.“I don’t want anything but just want a quiet life and want my parents’ life to be calmCalm yourself, why, why do you punish me so? "Alice's heart is full of grievancesThe Debuss family may be finishedHowever, is it related to her? Why did she finally have to deal with Merritt? Even forced she finally shouted out "I was once a woman of lei", this sentence to be exported, how difficult it was for Alice.Alice really didn't want to shout! "What happened to Alice's sister?" Rowling walked into the roomThen she saw Alice crying and she was still wet. She was worried about her.Rowling immediately lifted Alice "Don't cryDon’t cry, what’s with me, tell me?"Alice immediately turned and flew in Rowling's arms and cried even harder."Nobody's comfortingAs soon as someone comforts, Alice feels more grievancesRowling comforted for nearly half an hourAlice calmed down slightly“What happened to Alice’s sister?You told meRowling looked at AliceAlice takes a deep breathOnly slowly said the grievances of the heart: "Sister Rowling, you also know the current situation of the Debus family.When the grandfather came back yesterday, he asked me to speak alone. He wanted me to..."I feel angry at Nimitz's behavior, feel sorry for Alice, feel furious for the behavior of the beast, and even more sympathize with Alice."I don't care about it. I don't want to control it. I just want to live alone.Alice sobbedRowling has also been thinking about the way out for the Debus family these days, but after hearing Alice’s words, she also understands them."Alice's sister, don't be sadNo matter what, you can't be ruined by that Merritt's innocenceRowling comforted herAlice nodded"However, we also want to find ways to save kalan their"Laughlin said," Karan's elder brother is our fiance"Alice wants to save Karan, but she can't help"We still have a solutionRowling looked at Alice. "Just don't know if Alice's sister is willing to do it.""" Rowling..." Alice looked to Rowling, and her heart had already guessed.Rowling nodded. "Yes, you ask lei for help.Today, when you said lei, that Merritt would not dare to touch you.It is clear that lei's influence is very large. As far as I know, lei is not only related to the Holy See, but also to the Dawson Chamber of Commerce.Even when Clyde was kneeling against lei, it was not a general courtier. Instead, he was like a friend.If lei comes forward, the hope of saving kalan will be much greater."If anyone in the kingdom of Finlay has the biggest face, it is undoubtedly lei."It is the left phase and the right phase that cannot match leibiBecause it is obvious, lei will be a high-level figure in the futureAnd now it is already the object of cultivation of the absolute end of the Holy See.For lei, the two red cardinals went to lei's home to pay homage to lei's father.Can be imagined for lei"Lin big brother?" Alice is very complexActually, Alice knew that there was a way in her heart, but she didn’t want toShe really does not want to ask leiShe felt that she did not have that face to ask for leiShe knows that she hurt too much to leiIn particular, when seeing the stone ‘waking up’, Alice’s understanding of how deeply loved her loved herAt least once love was very deepShe does not have a face! "Elder sister, I understand your difficultiesRowling clutched Alice's hand tightly. "But Alice's sister, Karan's brother and his father are likely to lose their lives. Please, forgive, at least lei will not be like that of Merritt.""Alice is very painful in her heart.""No face? My face is important, or is it important for Cullen's brother and his father's life?” Alice asked herself, she didn’t have a choice."Alice's sisterRowling prays to see AliceAlice took a deep breath and tried to calm herself. She looked to Rowling and nodded. "Well, I'll see lei brother tomorrow.”
