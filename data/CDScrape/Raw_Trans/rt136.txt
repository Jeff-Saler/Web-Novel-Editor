"This Canter & Debus, it should be the third of the Debus family.Clyde said softly to the next lei, lei noddedLei and clyde they just watched things happen, but the debus family clan felt terrifiedMany of the Debusian families in that gallery shivered nervously.“Bang!” The chain banged, and under the escort of two sergeants, a middle-aged blond with thin pale face stepped into the trial chamber.The eyes of the people in the entire court met him, including Bernard, Karan, Nimitz and others.Seeing the middle-aged blond, Bernard sighed low and closed his eyes."Sure enough, it was the third child of the Debus family, Kanter!" A loud voice came from the audience. As the third child of the Debus family, most of the nobles in the city of Finlay knew Cant & Debus.On this copy, it was useless for the Debuss family to argue again.Merritt, who sat on the trial stage, looked at Clyde, and Clyde nodded slightly.Bernard"Merritt looks at Bernard." Now, what else do you have to say? Bernard did not look at Meryl but turned to look at his third brother ‘Canter’ and stared at KanterKanter also stared at his older brother, Bernard, and the two brothers stared at each other."The youngest, why are you doing this?" Bernard felt incredible in his eyes, his body quivered in pain and anger."I am sorry"Canter said softlyBernard wry smile and shook his head, solemnly said: "You are not sorry for me, but I'm sorry the entire Debus familyThe Debus family has been for so many yearsHow many generations of previous generations have worked hard to achieve success todayBut you, you..." Bernard couldn't speak in pain“Oh!” Kanter crouched down in the trial court, and two lines burst into tears."Big Brother, I'm gonna die!" The chained hand yanked on his face and cried, "Big Brother, I'm sorry, it's my fault."It's my lack of greed. It's because I'm not satisfied with my little rights in my family.Therefore, the family’s money was misappropriated for smuggling.It's my fault, big brotherit's all my fault! "This scene, it touches everyone in the audience.Lei and clyde are eyebrowsEven Merritt on the trial was brow"The matter has arrived on this copy.Bernard said, looking up at him, stifling that tears did not flow and the entire person looked so drowsy. “The youngest, now it’s no longer a mistake.”What you have done has caused our whole family to fall into an unprecedented crisis. I Bernard & DebusAs a family patriarchEven if it is dead, it cannot face the ancient generations"SpeakingBernard tears are still falling downBernard suddenly looked at Clyde and went straight down towards Clyde. The pain ran down and said: "Your MajestyThe Debuss family made such a villain who betrayed the kingdom. It was the misfortune of the Debus family.My Bernard as a patriarch can't get rid of culpabilityI am Bernard's willingness to die so that His Majesty can preserve our Debus family.After all, the vast majority of people in our family are innocent! Clyde looked at BernardImmediately look at Merritt, nodded slightly to MerrittMerritt knew what Clyde meant. He immediately said, "Adjourn the court now. After fifteen minutes, make a final judgment!" ... All the nobles who are observing must leave the trial court one by one. Only after fifteen minutes Can enter the trial againNow the situation is very clear. The Debus family is suspected of smuggling. In the end, how to punish it is entirely determined by Clyde.It is entirely possible to personally implicate the whole family in this way.Even if the Debus family is destroyed, it is reasonableOf course, Clyde can also have a bit of human touch, just to punish the Debuss family, at least for the Debus family to retainHow is the result, everything is decided by Clyde******* Outside the trial court, the Duke of Bernard was with Lin and talked with each other."LEI, did you see it? This debus family is really goodThe Kanter, actually got caught some time ago, and he doesn't commit suicide. He waited until he entered the court to perform the show.Duke Burner said with a smileLei also nodded in favor"If that Kanter commits suicide, I am afraid that the Debuss family will become even more passive.Lei said with a smileCanter commits suicide, and by virtue of Kanter’s corpse, it can be shown that the Debus family is suspected of smuggling.The Debuss family could not be justified, but Kanter himself admitted that he was alone.This is what gave the Debus family a chanceOf course, whether it is a student or not depends ultimately on the presence of Clyde."Kill, kill all."In the shoulders of the lei babe fangs licking their teeth, but also with the lei soul sounded," the debus family, too will actI can't stand it when Babe read it.Lei could not help laughing“Whoa~~~” opened the door to the trial court, fifteen minutes had passed, and the nobles from outside were able to get inside the fish and sat down safely in the gallery one by one.During the recess, only a few people, including Clyde and Melet, stayed in the trial court."LEI, guess, how did I get the penalty?" Clyde smiled at lei."I can not guess itLei repliedClyde mysteriously smiled“Stand up!” Merritt stood up and solemnly said, and suddenly the people in the whole court stood up and Meryl raised his head severely and remarked, “The court pronounced: Debus’ family member Canter. & Debus' openly carries out large-scale smuggling of Shuiyu ore, which is extremely largeSentenced to hang and executed on October 11<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "The smuggling of the Shuiyu ore is worth nearly 40 million gold coins, and the Derbus family is sentenced to double the penalty. 80 million gold coins, while Bernard & DebusCourt releaseThe sentence was completed.” Merritt’s words came out. Bernard, Nimitz, Kalan, and a group of Derbus’s family had breathed a sigh of relief. But their hearts were also helpless.80 million coins! What a terrible number! The entire Debus family’s property is also around 100 million gold coins.This is still plus all fixed assetsThis time, you have to pay a large amount of fines and you must sell a lot of fixed assets.This large-scale sale will definitely suffer from the other party's bargaining price.A total of nearly 80 million gold coins in fixed assets can be sold in the end 80 million gold coins, the possibility is too low"LEI, how about?" Clyde looked to leiLei smiled and nodded: "admire, admire"This Clyde's fine setting is very goodBecause the Debus family has about 80 million gold coins.If Clyde really punishes the genocide, it’s 100%Debris family's liquidity, Clyde is a piece of gold coins are not availableAnd if the penalty is too highI am afraid that the Debuss family will die and they will not pay fines.The 80 million gold coins, no more, a lot, just right"fatherA few people such as Kalan immediately came to pick up Bernard.Bernard looked at his younger brother, ‘Canter & Debus’. Kanter’s face was dark, but he nodded with Bernard.Since the smuggling was exposed, Kanter knew he must die.And now he died for the familyLater, the family will probably treat his son and his wife better.Bernard also nodded to KanTwo brothersJust rely on your eyes to understand what you are thinking"We, go backBernard sighedAfter this thingThe Debuss family is seriously injured and the economic strength can make a good achievement.Since then... The Debuss family has declined from the top level of the kingdom of Finlay.Can only be regarded as a relatively rich family林 林 邸 邸, spring water parkLei is sitting in a chair, a person quietly daze"LEI, what do you think?" Drin Corvette emerged from the dragon ringLin Lei looked at Drinkovt and said with a sigh: “Today I saw the trial of the Debuss family case. I suddenly thought of my family.My family was originally a vertical and horizontal magnolia mainland. Today, generations of people die. My father is dead. My mother does not know whether she is alive or dead.Little Wharton is now in the O'Brien empire, and now in the entire sacred alliance, I am unrequited.Lei has a very strong sense of lonelinessThe parents are not there, and they are now doing things that cannot be seen - revenge! Revenge on the road, lei every day is tightly tense, dare not have a trace of relaxationDeling Kettle looked at the lei, his heart has a hint of pity, do not look at the lei has matured on the surface, and deal with those great aristocracy is nothingBut... lei was only seventeen years old. It was only a short time before he left the academy."lei, relaxDo not give yourself too much burden, you have enough time"Drinkovt comforts the wayLei looked at Drincowwater. On this lonely road, thanks to Delin’s grandfather and the playful babe.“Grandpa Delin, thanksLei appreciatedDeling Kewater laughed"I really want to know the news of my mother earlier and kill Clyde sooner."Not to mention why Clyde had taken away his mother, he could simply separate his own family from his family for more than 10 years and eventually lead to the death of his father.This alone is enough to sentence him to death.“I don’t know when the king of the killings “Xisi”, when did he send the poison prescription?Lei heart eager... lei is looking forward to the arrival of the king of killing ‘Xicse’ every day, but one day passes and Xisse has not come yetIn an instant, it is already in October.This nearly a month, the Kingdom of Finlay is still calmIt is mainly the Debus family who sells the family’s property on a large scale.Many families took the opportunity to bargain, but the Debus family's fixed assets are indeed very high, there are many family needsSo the selling price is not too lowOriginally calculated 80 million gold coins of fixed assets, eventually sold more than 70 million gold coinsAfter paying a fine of 80 million gold coins, the Debus Group finally escaped the robbery.After this time, the wealth of the Debus family is almost 90%... On the 10th of October, tomorrow is the day when Canter hanged.On this day, lei practiced in the spring park as usual."I'm an adult from lei, she is!" the maid shouted out loud.Lei told us that if sisé arrives, it needs to be told immediately"Xisi came?" Lin immediately set a jacket, directly washed out of the spring water parkAt LEI's speed, LEI arrived outside the living room in less than ten seconds.At the moment, Xisse, still wearing a loose robe, is tilting his legs and drinking tea in the living room.“Mr.Lei shouted from afar, two or three steps, lei entered the living roomWhen Sisse saw lei's arrival, he couldn't help his eyes and immediately stood up: "Master lei, I'm really sorry to arrive today."Saying, Sisse took an envelope from his arms." "LEI, that's the prescription I said to you."”
