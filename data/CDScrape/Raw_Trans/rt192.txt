Red Sand City is a small town with a total population of tens of thousands of people.A group of people from the lei departed from the building and set off directly to the city of Shire. When it was marching to the city of Red Sands, he stopped for lunch.In the box on the second floor of the hotel, Jenny and Kean had a smile of excitement on their faces.“Haha, we will arrive in the county of the county of Cheshire in the evening. After that, the trouble estimate will be less.Keen said cheerfullyJenny also nodded: "When we arrived in the county of the county of the county of Hilgue, Auntie, she would not dare to start with us."" Jenny, Keane, not as easy as you thinkLei smiled lightly, "in the county of the county of the county of Sherbrooke, it may be more dangerousThe aunt you said is not as timid as you think."Woman poisoned, but it's terribleThree years in the Warcraft Mountains, lei has encountered a variety of sinister and hot peopleGianni, their aunt, could have killed Keane in the county of Shrek, and she could not even afford her."Really?" Keane was a little scared. After all, he was just a fourteen year old boy.Lei smiled and said: "don't think so muchThis afternoon we are not in a hurry to go to the county of the county of Chil, and rest in Hongsha City first.Wait until we start again tomorrow morning""tomorrow morning? "Jenny and Keane see lei"If I was expecting a good job, your aunt should be able to find out that we are coming from a dock in the upper reaches of the river.They should calculate that we will go to the county of the county of Hillow in the eveningSo... They have a group of people and they will wait for us in the evening"These simple calculations, lei easily judgedOnly need to think from the other sideIt's easy to hold the other's nose“We are rejuvenated and we start tomorrow morning.Lei laughed, "don't worry now, enjoy this lunch"Jenny and Keen also smiled on his face."...... Without Lin Lei’s expectation, a group of people such as Hallo’s pharmacist really arrived directly at the county of Chilcher, and a group of Widows in the county of Chilcher had earlier received the news.Chil Castle City UpstairsMrs. Widder is leaning against the city wall and looking out of the cityBehind her is her two older brothers, and Hallmore pharmacistAs for the county guards, they are far away"Mr. Hallmer, I'll have trouble waiting for you here for a while tonight.Mrs. Widder turned to look at Hallmore and said with a smile.The Holmes Pharmacist Still Knows HimselfHis own strength is not howStrong and strong in terms of using drugsNaturally, he does not want to offend the intrinsic town-owner of this ancient county town of Chil"Please, Mrs. Weed, rest assured that the siblings will never live into the city of Shaell.Hallmer's self-channel"Even if they have nine strong guards,As long as the 9th-level player does not reach the sanctuary boundary, I have a firm grasp of him.Of course...the premise is that he doesn't know me"If a nine-level strong person recognizes him, it is very easy to block the poison if he forms a grudge shield around his body surface.""Hall ink pharmacist you for so many years, can stay in my county town of Shille, not to show upHow many people can know you? Moreover, I heard that Hormo Pharmacist, you have the ability to change their appearance? "Mrs. Weed laughed and looked at Hallmore.Holme smiledFushou said: "HahaMrs. Wade, change her appearance? No lady, you said so exaggeratedJust use some drugs, change the color of your face and change the hair colorSlightly accent... Even acquaintancesAs long as you don’t look closely, you can’t recognize it."Mrs. Weed smiled and nodded." Then all look at you, Mr. Holm, and I'll be there in the hotel tonight, and wait for your good news from Mr. Holm.Hallmore laughed confidently... As time goes by, Mrs. Weeds in the hotel closest to the city gate has some doubts, because after a while it will be time for the gates to close.The rules of the county of Hears are closed on time at 10:00 pmHowever, a group of people from Jenny and Keane had not yet arrived. According to her news, a group of people from Gianni arrived in Hongsha City at noon.It's slow, it should beTen o'clockThe huge city gate slowly closed under the synergy of numerous city guards. He had been careful to prepare the Hallyoung pharmacist to walk down the ramparts with full of anger, and Mrs. Wade walked out of the hotel."Madame Weed, what's going on here?" Hallmer was really annoyed.After getting the news today, I took a hundred miles from the bank of the river and drove directly to the city of ChilThis is a bumpy ride on the road. It is indeed a crime for Hormo in the 300-year-old.Then he blows a cold wind on the wall and blows a nightThe gate is closed nowDid not come yet"The group of people didn't know what was going on, for fear it was stopped in Hongsha City.Mr. Holme, you are quiet in this hotel today. Wait till tomorrow."Mrs. Widder is not in a good mood"It can only be the"Hall ink is full of injustice... On the early morning of the next day, when the gate was opened, Hallmer began to wait quietly.When it was 9am, Hallmer really firedHolme rushed down the wall and entered the second floor of the hotel“Mrs. Widder, they’re not coming, I’m just going"Halmoe said directly," You sent a few people to me, at least let these people recognize the two siblings"Mrs. Widder also agrees with this idea: "Well, then, Mr. Trouble will run again."" This time, we must allow them to taste me"Hall ink whispered, eyes are killingA carriage was purchased in Hongsha City. The old servant Lambert drove the carriage. Jenny and Keen's siblings stayed in the carriage.As for lei, she is riding a black-printed clouded leopard ‘black lu’.Black Luk is two meters tall, and the body is wide enough and the hair is silky enough<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> lei riding this black clouded clouded leopard, no sense of vibration at all, more comfortable than riding or riding a carriageAnd the black-printed clouded leopard is running on the mountain.“Lee Brotherwhat time is it now? Keane pops his head out of the carriage and asksLei turned to look at him: "Don't worry, it's only ten o'clock. We're going to arrive at Shire County at eleven o'clock."Lei Lei sat down the black clouded leopard is indeed very scaryOther pedestrians on the road, seeing the lei pedestrians avoid the other side early to give way"Drive, drive"The hoofs came from afar. It was just three knights appearing for a while, but when the three knights saw lei, they were scared and stopped.""The good leopard"One of the knights admired the black Lu who looked at Lin Lei."Don't read it, let's goAnother Cavalier urgedAnd this timeFrom the rear there was a steed. A steered hunchbacked old man was sitting on the back of this horse.The speed with which the old man rode is slow, ticking“HahaYou see this old man, still riding, haha...” One of the knights laughed"Let's go, there's going to be something else"The three knights will continue to set off between laughter, and the hunchback old man is to look up at this group of people lei, this hunchback old man understandAccording to prior agreement, if you meet the goalSay ‘hahaYou see this old man, at least...’And Hallmore also knew that the mysterious power of the land was a black leopard.... "The three knights did not really have a knight's virtue."From the window, we see this scene to Keane, and after the three knights have left, they discontented."Lei frowned and looked at the hunchbackThe hunchback equestrian is really worryingLook at its appearance is obviously old to die, but the speed of the horse is not fast, but the hunchback old man is still shaking at the moment, it seems that the moment may fallThe legs are not tightAt this time there was also a team from behind the hunchback"Go away, old guy"A knight shouted loudly, and the hunchbacked man immediately shakes the horse, and the horse walks toward the road.“哎呦"When the horse traveled about ten meters away from a group of lei people, the humpbacked old man took a direct look and fell off immediately.""Grandpa fell down"Keen, who sees this scene through the window, immediately pulls the curtain off.However, as the hunchback elder falls and a light blue air diffuses from the humpback old man, this light cyan is extremely ‘light’, and it’s hard to notice the fact that it’s too light to observe.Just at this moment is the east wind, directly blowing the air flow lei group of people, of course, the first to breathe this breath is just to come from the rear line to the team“噗哧"It was altogether very simple. After one after another, one by one, the knights fell from immediately. Their black and white blood penetrated into their mouth and nose.""lei?" lei also feel the body a while wrong, his head is also a dizzy"Not good, toxicLei sensed the elements around the wind, obviously a light cyan gas is floating over, lei has breathed two at the momentLei blood dragon warrior blood in the body stirred up, and then the gas was actually absorbed directly, no harm to the leiThis toxic gas is a poisonous gas specially refined by Hall-Mo on human structure.However, Hall's ink is not expected, lei is actually very different from the normal person, his veins contain 'blood warrior blood', this is a nobler than the blood of Warcraft do not know how many times the bloodThe magic nucleus of the spine-backed armored dragon was also refined by the veins of this silk dragon blood warrior.The four ultimate fighters, their special level, ordinary people can not imagineThis poison gas can't hurt Dragon Blood Warriors at all."wind"With the wind's magician's control over the wind, lei immediately controlled the wind in the opposite direction and blew it in. The original gas flow immediately flew toward the east again.At the moment, the team that was sandwiched between the lei and the hunchback old ‘Hall ink’ team was already dead.The poisonous gas drifted to Holme, but Holmek did not hide. He had long been afraid of poisoning.He is not afraid of poison, but he is afraid of lei."Drive, drive"Hall ink is flexible at the moment, a stand up directly to the horseThen it quickly rushed toward the east.“Black LuLei said coldly"Hey--" The speed of the black-printed clouded leopard is terrible. I don't know how much faster it is than a horse.After seeing the blink of an eye, he crossed the distance of several hundred meters. Instead, he rushed to the front of Hallmer's ink, leaving behind only a series of afterimages.Hallmore saw lei suddenly appear in front of him, suddenly panicked“This brother, I’m also rich.As long as you let me go, how much gold do you want to say"Hall ink is more than three hundred years old, but he still does not want to dieLei remembered that scene was also a little scaredFortunately, he reacted quickly and rushed back in the opposite direction before the toxic gas drifted into the carriage."Poison gas? Are you a dead magician?" lei looked at this hall ink asked"The Necromancer?" Holme shook his head and shook his head. "No, I'm a pharmacist. This brother, I have a lot of money, ten thousand gold coins? Twenty thousand gold coins? Or, 100,000 gold coins?" "At this time, Hallmore wanted to save money.Lei is too lazy to deal with this person"Black Lu, solve himLei jumped and turned to the carriageAs for the black-printed clouded leopard, the fangs were exposed, and then a direct fluttering rushed towards Hallmore.“Ah, a million, a thousand... ah—” Hall’s ink had not been shouted and he was caught in a paw by the black-printed clouded leopard.(The first chapter to ~~~~)
