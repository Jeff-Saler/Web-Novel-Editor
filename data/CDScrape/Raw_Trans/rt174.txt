At the border of the Kingdom of Hess, over 800,000 troops gathered hereOn a vast expanse of land, the barracks fluctuate like a mountain and can't see the end. This huge army is arranged in an orderly manner.The front of the barracks is an empty area"Hey, Uncle Rant, if the Warcraft attack comes over, can we resist it?" said a teenager wearing armor looking only sixteen and seventeen.Beside the bearded strong man, he drank a small bottle from his bosom and took a small sip. He laughed and said, "Reassured, this time not only the elite team of our Kingdom of Hess has come, but even the Holy See. You sent a Holy Knight and there are many magicians...you can rest assuredThe magic of adults of magicians is very powerful""Yep"The young man was on the battlefield for the first time. Heard the words of the veteran, and his heart was more practical."But next to the strong man's heart is an annoyed, because he is really experienced the World of Warcraft's powerful, thousands of Warcraft rushed over, human resistance is only to take human life to fill"Oh," suddenly a deep voice came from a very distant place."Uncle Rant, what do I seem to hear?""NothingRand said, but Rand suddenly stared at the south with his eyes wide open. At the end of a vast deserted land, suddenly there was a dense array of small points."WarcraftWorld of Warcraft group! The other barracks of the barracks suddenly shrieked and shouted, and suddenly the entire military camp moved. From the highest commander of the army to the lowest soldier, all of them suddenly warned.In fact, the 800,000 troops are ready to fight"Okay, a lot!" Many human soldiers saw the distant World of Warcraft sucking cool air.I saw a row of bloodthirsty iron steaks in a distant muscle grazing in a row, rushing towards the human side.There are over 10,000 bloodthirsty iron cattle"The thunderous bloodthirsty ox rushed and the whole earth shook up. Each bloodthirsty oxen's eyes were red, and the whole body blew out a flame.At first glance, it looks like a sea of ​​fire.Earthquake trembles, the sea of ​​fire is boundless"Oh!" "Oh!" "Oh!" Suddenly there was a green and almost transparent javelin in the sky. The sky-high javelin shot was a bloodthirsty iron herd."Is a magicianMany people’s hearts are overjoyed“噗哧"The power of each javelin is surprisingly large. As a branch of the ice system in the water system, it is the greatest power to deal with this kind of firepower.A handle ice gun or pierced the earthOr penetrated the bloodthirsty iron cattle body"Hey!" There is a javelin directly piercing the Bloodthirsty Iron Cattle's guilt, bloodthirsty Iron Cattle ran a few steps and crashedA head of bloodthirsty iron cattle died, but the vast majority of bloodthirsty iron cattle continued to run, even if slightly injuredOnly make bloodthirsty iron cattle more crazyBloody red earth when bloody"Hey Bloody Iron Man is mad"ArcherPrepare - ejection! The officers shouted loudlyThe sky and arrows bow to the skyThen, numerous bows and arrows burst into the sky and descend densely from the sky.A sharp, sharp arrow descends from high altitude and shoots on a bloodthirsty oxHowever, bloodthirsty Tieniu's grave raised its muscles and it easily resisted an arrow.The human approach to the human army does not work with the bloodthirsty oxen"Strikers, knots"The burly warriors, all wearing thick and heavy armor, came out. They all armed with a steel rifle and they were all in a position to wait for the attack of the bloodthirsty Tigress."The bloodthirsty Titans are red with their eyesNumerous root steel spears greeted bloodthirsty oxen, bloodthirsty iron ox rushed down with his head, as if the flood of the embankment crashed into the rifle.“噗哧Bloodthirsty Iron Cattle was directly punctured by steel lancesCan serve as a squadronAt least three soldiersIn addition, each soldier’s body depends on each other’s crooked battles.Leverage each other to helpThe first batch of bloodthirsty iron cattle did not break through the defensive formation, but the bloodthirsty iron cattle in the rear still desperately rushed.The Battle of the World of Warcraft is very tragic with the human army. The blood of the World of Warcraft is not just bloodthirsty.There are also wolf packs, there are even more terrible elite fire lions, there are also the line of dragons, raptors, etc. ... but the human army is not weakNot only the various general arms of the surface, some powerful magicians did not really take it out, and there were seven or eight levels of sentiment sent by the Supreme Church of God, and even a few nine magicians.There is also an elite Holy Knight.... On the 3rd day, the human army eventually had to retreat.In just three days, the human army has killed more than 300,000 people. The number of injuries is even more striking.The World of Warcraft army is also dead and injured.No matter whether it is the World of Warcraft or the human army, they are very understanding and do not use the sanctuary.The Sanctuary was only watching in the distance but did not shoot.Hess City chaosIn the first world war, the human armies withdrew hundreds of milesThe city of Hess is very close, and many people in Hess have decided to flee north again.Hess City, the secluded mansion where lei lived"Yale, we're going to go soon, fast, don't waste time.Monroe & Dawson scolded, "I estimate that the human army will not be able to sustain a few days and that the war will reach the city of Hess."Yale nodded: "I knowfather"" However, the youngest of him ... ...
