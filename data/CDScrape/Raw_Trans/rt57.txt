World of Warcraft is endlessInto this, I don’t know if ancient trees that have grown for hundreds of years or thousands of years are covered in trees, all kinds of weeds are everywhere, and thorns are also clustered.The dead leaves fall to the ground and the sound of natural footing will be heard on the ground. The old rattan weeds are densely packed around the ground.“This kind of forest, which is not known for many years, is also very dense. Weeds and vines are also dense. It is estimated that there is a World of Warcraft hidden within ten meters and the eyes cannot see it.Lei heart burst of worryDrinkovel is also next to"Don't say ten meters away, lei, in front of you in this weedy forest, maybe there is a big python"Drinkovt said with a smileLei could not help but look at the weeds in front of this piece of grass, this weed is extremely mao sen almost half high, so dense weeds may indeed have a python in it, take a deep breath, lei standing in place, mouth magic spell magicSuddenly, a slight wind radiates in all directions with lei as the center, eventually disappearing between heaven and earth.Wind magic - find the wind! Generally reach the level of the third magician, you can display 'wind of the discovery', but the stronger the strength, the wider the scope of the wind to find out, the magic of the third-level magic of the wind is also in the range of more than ten meters, and five The magician's detection style is over 100 meters“In the range of nearly two hundred meters, there is only one level of Warcraft Bubble Bunny, followed by a few second-tier Warcrafts.Lei said confidentlyThe wind of discovery can feel the shape and breath of creatures"Don't be too confident. A powerful World of Warcraft can sneak into the ground. Even some Sanctuary World of Warcraft can disguise itself."Drincowate reminded, and then said with a smile," Of course, you are a little person, those powerful World of Warcraft face you, do not need to disguise, sneakLei listened to this, his heart was more careful“Sneak? Camouflage? The book records the wisdom of Warcraft close to humans, it does not appear to be false"Ray leeway in the heart, looked at the shadowy mouse ‘babe’ on his shoulder. “The babe's wisdom is already high, it can’t be taken care of.”Lee's soles are surrounded by air flow, which is the effect of the wind system assisting magic ‘speed’.Lei all the people quietly marched in the middle of the mountains of warcraft, careful attention around, lei on the shoulders of the shadow mouse also greedy attention around, two small eyes are also carefully watched in all directions, one person a World of Warcraft This is getting deeper into the mountains of Warcraft."The Mountain of Warcraft is over ten thousand miles long, and the width is generally about seven hundred or eight hundred miles. In the outermost hundred miles range, it is generally low-level Warcraft, and if it goes deeper than one hundred miles, it is the five-level six-level World of Warcraft.If you go deeper, there will be a lot of World of Warcraft seven, eight, and nine, and even the Sanctuary of Warcraft may appear."Derrinkovt again told lei about some of the information of the Warcraft Mountains"Of course, this is not absolute, maybe a certain level 9 Warcraft will be boring to go outside on a circle"Derlin Corvette said," It's also possible that I'm unlucky enough to run into a large number of Warcraft Wolves. If that happens, I can only say that you didn't have a good life.Lei listened to delin kowwater and couldn't helpnonsense! The range of the Warcraft Mountains is so large that they are so unlucky? And once things happened, only the soul of Dillingkewater was no way to help.There is no magic magic sanctuary, what attack power? "Grandpa Delrin, I know all of these, you are quiet, don't distract me." lei said gassyDeling Kewater immediately smiled and touched the white beard, no longer sayIn the mountains and mountains of the mountains of Warcraft, the dense old tree leaves almost all the raindrops are blocked, and only occasionally some rain drops, lei walks in the mountains of Warcraft for a period of time, also know that this area of ​​the outer range of Warcraft Not dangerousLei's feet slightly force, the whole person will leap to the tree squat seventy-eight meters high, lei carefully looked at the distance"Boss, in the far right behind, there is a wild boar"Bebe's voice rang in lei's headLei could not help but turn around to see it, and sure enough in the distance about a hundred meters or so, I saw a single wild boar is carefully watching around, if not high lei station, I'm afraid lei can not see this single horn Wild boar<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "A single-horned wild boar, three-level Warcraft, attributed to the ground, will only show the gunLei message about the unicorn beast"Although it's just a third-level Warcraft ‘wildhorn wild boar’, but it’s also good for lunch. Wild boar is still good" lei as the whole person as a result of agilely in the middle of the forest, quietly approaching the single wild boar in the past, because the dense grass thorns, that the single-horn wild boar can not pay attention to leiWhen there is nearly ten meters near the one-horned wild boar, lei hides in the weeds. It can also be seen clearly through the wild grass."Call!" lei as the whole dragon out of the hole, suddenly jumped out from the weeds, when the single-horned wild boar alertly turned around, lei is like falling from the sky, with a breeze to the wild alone wild boar, The solitary wild boar was immediately slammed, and the thick, long horn on top of the head directly pierced the lei"Drink!" lei grabbed the right horn with his right hand, suddenly forced a liftThat hundreds of heavy single-horned wild boar was directly lifted by the lei to seven or eight meters high, and LEI jumped at the foot of the whole person, his right leg fluttered like a scythe, like a rush of thunder The single-horn boar's head"Pang!" The single-horned wild boar was hit heavily on a big tree with a sour-boned bone chipping and then fell heavily. Even the ground was shocked.I saw that the single-horned wild boar skull was cracked. The brain fluid penetrated through the cracks in the skull. The blood in the mouth continued to permeate outwards. The limbs trembled and trembled two or three times without moving.Rely on the strength of the soldiers to kill a third-level Warcraft, it is not difficult for lei"Although the magic crystal nucleus of the third-class Warcraft is worth only ten gold coins, it cannot be wasted."LEI Lei from the back of the leather package out of that handle flat knife, flat knife is just two or three under the easy to fully open the skull, flat knife gently Alice, an obscure yellow crystal core will jump up Lei, one hand and one hand rubbed in the grass and put it in the packageThen the flat knife in the hand of Lei Lei skillfully cut the thigh skin of the solitary wild boar and intercepted four wild trotters.Feel free to cut some branches, lei, one hand and a wave of flame appeared, took a simple grill, lei began to roast trottersXiao Ying mouse 'Bebe' drooling, eyes staring at the trotters: "This is the best trotter meat, boss, hurry up, hurry up, you simply use the fire magic to this trotter "It's not good to cook up quickly?" "Fire magic? I'm just a half-calm fire magic, not to mention the barbecue, but not the higher the temperature the better the fire the better” lei grinned, also took some coarse salt and other materials on topWhen lei first tested the magic talent, the affinity of the elements of the ground system and the wind system was super, while the fire system was medium.In fact, the medium magic talent is also very good for the average person.However, for LEI, it is too lazy to waste energy in the magic of fire.After all, if you want to make your own achievements in the fire system and catch up with the wind, it is estimated that it will take ten times more energy.Therefore, lei is only in the ordinary time to arbitrarily refine some of the magic of the fire system, but the release of the fireball is still easyRoasted two trotters, one lei and a small hamster babe, and at the same time continue to roast the other two trotters"Wow, it's delicious"Bebe's eating excitedly, while communicating with Lin Lei," This wild trotter meat, comparable to domestic trotters meat is much better, the taste is also very fragrant, of course, the boss's credit to your skills” Bebe also patted LEI’s assLei could not help laughing"Boss, I still want to eatAfter babe eats one, it can't help but look miserably to leiSee the poor phase of Bebe, lei is not the slightest soft, reprimanded: "This is connected to a wild trotter on the thigh, can be much larger than a roast chicken, one is enoughThe remaining two trotters are for dinner"Lonely, lei will ignore the poor phase of babeWhen the two trotters were cooked, lei packed the two trotters with large eucalyptus leaves and placed them in the mezzanine of the parcel. Then he continued on the road with Bebe.
