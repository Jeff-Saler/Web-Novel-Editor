The whole body covered with black scales, and black spikes appeared on the knees and elbows. The roots of the whole back were lined with spikes, especially the lei that had become dark gold.The cold, dark golden pupil stared at Padson alone, and Paedsson was flustered."Who are you? Who are you?" Paderson's face was pale with horror, and he stuttered for a moment but took his word.What is the monster in front of me? "Who am I?" Riesling stared coldly at Padson"Hey, hey ~ ~" bones tremors continue to spread out from everywhere in Padson's body. Lin's iron-like tail binds Paterson's entire body tightly and powerfully.No matter how hard Padson's arms are, he can't move.Pain, transmitted from the bones of the two arms to the whole body"You are the other plane?" Paderson's eyes full of panic, lei now looks like Padson, only heterotopic race is possible, "lei, beg you, spare me Life, I will not pass on your secrets, I promise"Padson was staring at lei's dark golden eyes and was completely panicked"Leave your life?" Lin Lei's face floated a touch of cold smile, "It is not impossibleI want to ask you. Did you send someone to catch a woman about twelve or three years ago?A look at PadsonHe immediately desperately recalled the things he had done twelve or three years ago, but it was too far away two or three years ago.The most important thing is..." LEI, no, lei adultsI, I can't think of itPaderson panicked“It’s been a long time, and I’ve often given my favorite woman to catch my house.I can't remember exactly what you said"LEI could not help but start to killThis Padson turned out to be always catching a womanPadson simply can not be seen from the surface of the lei to see the changes in the heart of the lei, the full length of the lei, the whole people are cold, merciless, horrible“The woman who had just given birth to a child and had just finished her prayers at the Temple of Glory and returned to the hotelLei still looked coldly at Padson, the sound is not the slightest undulationsPaderson heard lei talk about this, the whole person froze for a whileThen shocked and looked at lei"Is it remembered?" lei said coldlyPadson naturally thinks that he has been for so many yearsA woman who had just given birth to a child soon caught him twice.Natural memoryEspecially when it was 12 or 13 years ago, the person who asked him to do this was asking him to keep secret."I can't really rememberPadson panicked"I'm begging you, lei, please let me alone. I don't really know. You must be mistaken.” lei dark gold pupil Li Mang flash"you wanna dieLei sounds more and more cold“Ah~~” Paderson screamed in pain, and Lin’s powerful tail tied him harder and harder.More and more terrifying forces make Paderson's whole body skeletons buzz"Hey ~~" The sound is tremulousLei can still stare at Padson"Oh!" "Ah!" The sound of a bone breaks crisply, and Paderson screams painfully.The bones of his left arm were literally snapped apart."not bad” lei corner slightly tiltedSeems to be laughingBut Paderson doesn't think it's a laugh. Today, after ‘Longhua’ looks like, lei’s appearance at the corner of his mouth will only make Paterson’s heart more scared and scared."You know how important it isMost of the grudge is used to protect the body's internal organsJust a small amount of grappling protection armAlso, if the arm is broken, it will not kill, but the internal organs will be broken. It may lose life.Lei sound calmPadson felt his throat dryHe never thought that lei would have such a terrible scene"Is it remembered now?" lei addedPadson really wanted to answer, but when he recalled the punishment of the result, he could not help but tremble.Immediately, the performance was even more pathetic. He cried and said, "I'm begging you, arrogant, don't torture me.I don’t know, I’m not sure if you just killed me."Padson firmly believes that this has been more than a dozen years ago. How old is lei? It is estimated that lei's investigation is only a sporadic piece of information. It is certainly not 100% sure. If he does not let go, the other person may still believe him.""If I know I already said, lei adults, how can I be guilty?Lei adults, I beg you find out the truth"Padson's tears have flown down and his performance is so sincereIf lei does not have letters left by his father, he may still really hesitate.Lei looked at Padson, his mouth curled up more and morePadson's heart is a greeting"Very good, very goodLei still tied with paddleson's tail, suddenly the dragon tail forced paderson to paralyzed the ground to the marble ground, fortunately lei is let paderson's head downLei long tail power burst! Two thighs crashed into the marble ground"Pang!" The bones cracked quickly, and Paderson's shrill screams sounded at the same time.Padson's left knee, the bones of Whiteson actually pierced through the muscles, punctured the pants and came out.The white spurs just came out of the thighsThe right leg is directly on the ground, especially the one's ankle, the blood is completely red pants"Ah, ah, ah~~~" Paderson is constantly screamingThis kind of pain simply killed his life, and the internal organs were lucky enough to have vindictive protection.At least saved their lives"Devil, the devil"Padson's constant curses, he is very clear that lei's great power, with the strength of his seven soldiers can not keep all parts of the bodyCan only stubbornly keep the internal organs from being damagedPadson does not want to dieLeg broken? Nothing, as long as there is enough money, it is entirely possible to ask the nine major devils of the Holy See to display the ‘Song of Life’ as long as they are not killed on the spot.Heavy injuries can be restored! "Is it remembered? Have you caught that woman?" lei's voice is still calm, without any undulationsBut Paderson's heart is more and more afraid<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "Remember, think of itPadson's forehead sweated. It was painful. It was scared.Padson is very clear that he and lei are in a secret room inside the secret room, the closed room is closedThe loud voice in the interior, I am afraid that only outside the stone gate can barely hearHowever, this secret small building, who will be outside Shihmen listening to it? He shouted loudly again, and nobody would know."Speak earlyIsn't it hard to use this bitterness? Lei double dark gold eyes quietly watching Padson, "say itTell me the original things"Padson quickly nodded:" lei adults, when I saw that woman is really beautifulFor a moment, I was sent to take this woman to plunder.I want to let this woman go to bed with me, but this woman is too reluctant to commit suicide on the wall."Said Padson slyly looking at leiIn Paderson's view, there are not many people in the world who know the traces of that woman, and lei should not know"You still lie!" lei finally angered, and that dark gold pupil even gradually reddenedLei control the dragon tail tied with Padson, has been moving Padson to their ownLei close to Padson's faceColdly looking at each otherLook closely at leiLei looked at the body of black scales, watching lei spike on the foreheadPadson is more and more worried"I didn't lie. I didn't lie!" Paderson said quickly.Lei has turned into a dragon claw's right hand and suddenly faced Padson's face is a slap“Hey!” Paderson’s left face immediately grabbed five pieces of meat and his blood continued to emerge.Fortunately, LEI did not want his lifeOtherwise, this slap would be enough to shoot his head out."Hey, hey~~~" Padson's sore voice changed.Lei looked at Padson coldly: "Padderson you listen to me, I already know a lot of things, so you still do not lie to me, or you suffer more than just theseI can tell you that the woman you first caught was my mother! ""mother? "Padson was stunned all of a sudden"My mother was very clear about what I was doing and I've been checkingSo you better tell me all the news about my mother, otherwise... you must dieLei sounds even more unfathomableIn fact, regardless of Padson's speech, Padson is necessarily dead.Because of his father, Padson is killing people and eventually dying.This Padson is not clear that he sent a man to kill a man in the past few months is the father of leiIf you know...I'm afraid Paderson's reaction will be another look"Tell me, who did you send my mother to?" lei stared at Padson."You know?" Paderson paledLei actually knew he gave the woman to another person? "Tell me his name, don't just deceive meIf I find you deceive me, I will make you worse offLei's voice is still calm without undulationsPadson pondered for a moment"I told you it was useless. You couldn't kill him.Padson said lowly"Can't you die?" lei looked at Padson coldly. "Padson, you listen to me. You just need to tell me his identity. As for whether I can kill him, I don't need you to control it."How much do you know about my real strength? Padson heard this and secretly agreedThe ‘Leslie’ in front of him is too horrible. The strength originally expressed in the Ming Dynasty makes him think that he is an absolute genius.But now it seems that this lei's strength is even more powerful than his 7th level warrior.In front of him, he did not even have the power to fight back.Padson's thoughts in mindLei did not press, but with that dark gold pupil staring at PadsonPadson had been thinking for a long time, finally saw his teeth and looked at him: "LEI, I tell you his identity, but you must ensure that I can't let anyone know that I told you! And you can't kill me.Lei's face remained indifferent: "well, I promise not to let others know that you told me, but also to ensure that I do not kill you"Padson breathed a sigh of relief“Almost 12 years ago, once the children of our royal family in the Kingdom of Finlay went to the Temple of Light, and in the Temple of Light we saw your mother.Later, I sent someone to catch your mother."Padson immediately said," Actually, it was not my wish. I just listened to the orders of others.""Who? Lei immediately askedPaderson looked at LEI and slowly said, "That's my big brother. Now King of the Kingdom of Finlays is kneeling down Clyde."" Clyde? Lei leiIt is the pride of the kingdom of Finlay, who is known as the Clyde of the Golden Lion. Nine strong Clyde? "Yes, Clyde."Padderson made sure," but I know that Clyde is very important to your mother. He also said to me, in any case, you should not reveal this news, otherwise he will die.Lei sounds more and more coldLei watching paderson"What he said should be true"Drinkingwater's voice rang in the mind of lei." I feel the fluctuation of his soul.Lei heart must bePadson seeks to see lei: "lei, can you spare my life? I promise, I will never leak half the word todayPadson's eyes are full of hope"Okay, I keep my promiseLei's tail suddenly releasedPaderson's whole person fell to the ground, Padson's face could not help but a hint of ecstasy, watching lei's eyes full of gratitudeAt this time, a black shadow flashed“咔嚓"The Shadow Mouse 'Babe' is biting into Padson's neck, and Padson is watching in horror at the bebeJust fleeing to birth, but in an instant, he felt close to the underworld call.Padson recognized the shadow mouse is the little mouse that is often on the shoulder of the leiPaderson looks at lei incredibly"I said I didn't kill you, but I didn't say that my Warcraft doesn't kill you."LEI looked down at Padson, who kept bleeding from the throat." By the way, I told you one thing. Some months ago someone was lurking in your house of the Duke. Later you sent someone to kill him. That man, my father! ”
