Sword cultivation, the most basic is the strength, vindictive use of epeeIn the successful implementation of the black ebony epee, in the Hess City, when lei attacked the purple deacon super deacon using the black tactical epee, even the strength and vindictiveness could not be used to qualify.Using epee, it is not rigidly relying on force to swing EpeeInstead, it saves as much power as possible. It allows the epee to speed up. At the same time, strength and vindictiveness match the epee with perfection.Lei spent more than a year, finally able to use the black tactical epee to arm to finger, without wasting a little strengthWith limited power and vindictiveness, the power of black pheasants is maximizedHowever, this is only the basisBeyond this first layer, the second layer is a kind of realm. This is just a few days ago when Lin Lei saw the sudden realization of the water flowing through the mountains.Lightweight, simpleIn essence, it is the perfect control over vindictiveness and power. It is like the flood is constantly being blocked by savings. When it is the moment of the embankment, the power of bursting is very scary.The trick of ‘Peng Lei’ is this principleTo put it simply, but it is necessary to use it on a very solid basis. If there is no perfect use of vindictiveness and strength, it is only to realize this artistic conception."So powerful? Boss, isn't this the most powerful epee?”Lei shook his head and smiled: "As soon as possible, according to records in my family books, the use of heavy weapons, is simply divided into three levels, one is the foundation to achieve perfection, the second is light weight, and the third is the 'potential'"" Potential? Bebe was somewhat confused. "What is that? ""I do not know eitherLei shook her head and said, "After all, my family's cheats are in addition to the "Dragon Blood Code."Just introduce some history of the family, and some ancestorsAbout the ancestor who used the hammer, he only introduced his strength with a few lines of words.In the book, I only said that the third realm is ‘shi'. As for what ‘shi' is, I’m not going to elaborate on it. I don’t know."LEI does not understandPotential, is it imposing? However, how much power can you add to the attack even if you have the power to attack? "Not understandingHow can't understandLei shaking his headLei is very clear, in fact, at the level of 'light weight', he has not yet reached the perfect levelBecause the most important thing about this move is the last burst of attack power.If you make the most powerful burst? Lei is now only extensive to let power, vindictiveness burst into a go, but lei understand, this is the most stupid"There is no shortcut to the way of cultivation.Lei smiled, no longer cranky****** Into the late autumn, even the original trees in the mountains of Warcraft are mostly yellow.It is now counted as the late autumn of Magnolia Calendar in 10001. It has been more than a year and a half since Lin Lei entered the Mountain of Warcraft.Lei has only traveled five or six thousand miles awayIt's a daily practice and it's about ten miles on the way.In the middle of the night, everyone is still alive. In the core area of ​​the Mountain of Warcraft, under a big tree that needs four or five people, Lin Lei sits in bed and meditates.Gradually ... ... dawn, and lei also opened his eyes, his face more than a smileThe early morning breeze blew with a few dead leaves falling from the air and slowly falling down. LEI looked at the fallen leaves and silently."Big boss?" Babe opened her eyesSuspiciously, "You wake up, why don't you call me?" In fact, lei wakes up every day and babe actually wakes up naturally.Just babe had to wait for the lei to shout every day before he opened his eyesBut today LEI did not call him"Bebe, I seem to break throughLei suddenly voiced the soul said"Breakthrough?" Bebe immediately stood upSurprise asked, "What break?" lei laughed: "My spiritual power finally reached the level eight magician level"" Eight magician? ” Bebe immediately exclaimedIn fact, in the winter of the sixteenth year, lei made a stone ‘dream awakening’. The rapid growth of ten days and ten nights led Ling’s spiritual power to increase tenfold at once and reach the spiritual strength of the mid to late seven magician.At the age of sixteen, it was seven years later.In fact, for almost three years nowIn that period of time, in the city of Finlay, the growth rate of lei's spiritual power was half. According to that speed, lei would probably need five or six years to enter the eighth magician.However, this year's half of the lei in WarcraftThe soul is fully integrated with nature, and each sculpture fits naturally into natureThe increase in mental power is very obviousAt this moment ... ... lei's spiritual power finally reached the level of eight magician"Big boss, how powerful the eight magician?" Bebe said curiously"You try, do not you know?" LEI's face showing a trace of funny smile, babe is a blink of an eye, and then from the channel: "come, my beibei even eight do not care about Warcraft, but also an eight magic? Lei immediately chanted magic spellsAfter a moment, a large number of surrounding elements quickly gathered around leiThe magic of the land in the body of lei has also stirred up"Call ~ ~" Lin Lei suddenly hit the front wind, the defeated leaves have also taken off the volume upJust heard a roar sound, a khaki-foot three-meter-high wolf appeared in front of lei, this giant wolf is three meters high, nearly ten meters long, the body muscles are like iron spades, strong and powerful limbsGrade 8 magic is the earth's whistle! "Hey!" This earth shouted wolf shouted at Bebe, and Babe was standing arrogantly and confidently waiting for this terrible wolf.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "噗哧-" very abruptly babe emerges from the ground"Wow” Babe yelled and jumpedHowever, the sudden burst of guns did not hurt Beibei slightest, and this time the Earth Xiao Xiao Lang has arrived in front of it, Beibei immediately screamed, the volume swelled up"Hey ~ ~" Earth shouting wolf opened his mouth to bite Beibei, Beibei equally angry bite to the earth wolfOnly hear "click"Babe snapped the throat of the earthly wolfHowever, the earthly wolf was so unaware that the claws actually caught directly at Beibei."Snapped"Bebe was caught flying directly. He squatted on the ground and cracked the cracks on the ground. Bebe immediately crawled up and stared at the terrible wolf.Just now, the power of the claws of the earthly wolf is still very large"Bebeh, this terrible wolf is not really a Warcraft, but a line of cymbals. It is composed entirely of magical power and elements.Nothing is importantLei squeakedBebe instantly understandsFor a body consisting of mana and elementsYou bite his throat and bite his tail, it makes no difference."Hey ~ ~" Bein finally angered, and directly into a dark shadow to the earth shouting wolf, the earth shouted wolf is also a bite to himBut Bebe is dodging, while the pair of small claws madly grabbed the earth shouting wolf, blinked in the ground to catch nearly 100 paws in the body of the Wolf, just to let the other body to the brink of collapse"Pang!" Earth shouting wolf light flashes, it will suddenly explodeBebe was bombed and flew straight up, squatting beside a big treeBreak the big tree breaksThis fell to the ground"bebe, how?" lei is very clear beibei strength, this attack can not hurt babeBabe ran over for a while and said: "The boss, that earth wolf is not less than the general level of Warcraft 8And it's not a big dealIt's a pervert, and it's blew up when you die."The body collapses and the mantle that consists of magical power and elements naturally explodesEight-level double magician, even in the normal human form, lei is also considered a real strongEight magical powers are amazingSuch as the wind's tyrannosaurus reel, this tyrannosaurus is not difficult to destroy thousands of troops.Actually it was a ‘big wolf’ attackThe general small army must be finishedEarthly wolf wolf defense is amazing, and only Bebe's perversion can be so simple to break the defense of the earth wolf.Earthly wolf, fast, defensive, and hardly criticalPut it in an army and the damage is imaginable"8 MagicianFor a country, the degree of importance is more than one million peopleLei understand this truth, and the nine magician is more important than a 100,000 teamAs for the Sacred Mages, the importance is more than one million troops.Directly a curse, ‘Destruction Storm’, millions of troops are almost dead.LYN's elemental affinities are super, etc., natural refining magic power consumption is very shortIn addition to the ‘ping genre’ carving method, lei does not need much time spent on magical cultivation.Since it can be dragonized, warriors naturally have to double their efforts.... holding the black epee epee, LEI walking on a big mountainIn the hands of the black pheasant, the epee freely moves around, pats, and squats...When the black epee touches those boulders, the boulders will instantly collapseOr it is broken into dozens of pieces, or it is directly burst, or it is turned into powder.... lei is constantly experimenting, how to use ‘Beng Lei’ to make it more powerfulIf you use the same number of vindictives, the power is greater"callLei feel the dragon blood grudge consumption most, when even put away black yu epeeIn his hand, purple blood soft sword appeared in his handLei immediately jumped up, the hands of purple blood soft sword is also floating up and floating upThe advantage of the purple blood soft sword is the speed and the strange changes"Oh!"
