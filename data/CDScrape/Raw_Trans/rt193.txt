I don't know if this is? "" That's Big Brother.Keane replied first“Ray?” Mrs. Widder's eyelids lifted and she laughed. “Oh, Mr. Ray.It must be Mr. Ray escorting them all the way to the town of Hearshire.I will definitely replace Jenny and their siblings.

"Mrs. Widder's eyes gradually fierce."It seemsOnly that way, Mrs. Widder’s eyes were relieved and she was only confident and cold.In the huge living room of the castle, the huge ceiling glass lamp shines in the candlelight, reflecting the charming light.All the nobles of the county of Hears gathered here<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>“I heard that the son of Count Weeds came back and I don’t know how this Mrs.""who knows?

Just living in the county of Chilcher, they also secretly squatting in the most, but dare not face offended Lady Weed"Mrs. Widder is coming"The aristocrats who spoke all the time stopped talking and turned to look at Mrs. Widder who had walked down the stairs. Mrs. Widder was still so luxurious and her posture was still so arrogant.Mrs. Widder enjoyed the gaze of the crowd and walked down the stairs with her head slightly up."You"Mrs. Weed said with a smile." Today is a big day, and I have two poor children who have eaten for eight years.Finally came back todayAt this time, two people suddenly walked out of the stairs.A teenager dressed in a black gentleman costume and a blonde woman in a white dress came out togetherMany nobles are eye-catchingAlthough Janeni wears a simple and simple dress, but with her appearance, plus the gentle and pure temperamentIt is a tremble for everyoneMany young aristocrats have decided to take a moment to ask about it.The woman's message"Jenny, Keane, come hereMrs. Weed greeted me warmlyJenny and Keane also descended the stairs and stood beside Mrs. Weed.Mrs. Weeds warmly introduced: "This is Jenny.

Keen, who was just 14 years old, was rather indecisive and sarcastic: "Aunt, how have you never seen us in these eight years? We have always wanted your aunt."Mrs. Weed faced her face and said with a sigh:" I have been working hard on everything in the county of the county of Chershire these years. There has been no time.Every time you think of this, you feel that you owe too much to your siblingsLei said with a smile and said directly: "Madame Weeds, Lord Weeds's death, and Keane is his heir."This time, Keane came back to inherit the position of the Lord of the City, and did not know when Mrs. Weed would prepare Kein to take over the position of the Citylord. "The words came out and suddenly fell in the whole living room."All the nobles in the field understand that the highlight isAt the same time, those nobles were puzzled and looked at LEI. They did not understand where they came out. They even asked the question directly.Mr. Lei"Mrs. Widde looked awkward and chilled." You protect Keane and Gianni to the town of Chilcher. I, as their aunt, I am grateful to you.But let Keane inherit from the landlord. This is a matter within our family. It's not a good idea for an outsider to intervene."Keane immediately retorted:" Who said that Big Brother is an outsider? "" What is not an outsider? "Wade's face is very coldKean looked at him and looked at Lin Lei, and said, "But Lei, but my spouse's fiancé is an outsider?" "Fiance?" Mrs. Widder was covered.JennimonLei is also covered"Fiance?" lei immediately looked at Keane, Keane is blinked against lei, lei suddenly understood the meaning of KeaneAt this time, Jenny’s face was red."How?"
