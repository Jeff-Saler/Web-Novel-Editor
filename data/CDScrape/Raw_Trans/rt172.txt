At the same time, the shock wave of terror spreaded in all directions. The ground rolled like waves and the houses collapsed and the trees splattered.Within a radius of several hundred meters into ruinsThis terrible roar resounded throughout the Hess City, whether it was the practisers just outside Hess, or the Dawson Chamber of Commerce, or other masters.Everyone feels the vibration here...

"Little guy, hello, my name is Drincowwater, the Sanctuary of the Pu'ang Empire!" Delingkwater was first contacted by lei.... "Grandpa Delin, how do you not speak? How is my element affinity?" lei first test magic talent"Very good, very good, your element has a very high affinity"Drincowwater's face is full of smiles," as far as I knowIt is estimated that it is difficult to find an element in one thousand magicians that can keep up with you. Really."Drinkovt's praise makes Kobayashi extremely excited.... A sanctuary in the era of the Puang Empire, a small childIn this way, the children embarked on the magical path with the help of the Puang Imperial Mage......... The stone carving of the flat knife school, the cultivation of the Warcraft Mountains.Under the guidance of the elders of the Derinking Water, lei grew at an alarming rate.When lei became the focus of the crowdNo one knows that there is a Sanctuary Mage’s soul in the era of the Puang Empire.... "LEI, I will depend on yourself later."Dr. Delin touched lei's head for the last time.With the earth-shattering taboo magic, "The Rock Drops," the soul of Grandpa Delrin has dimmed."LeiGoodbye""Remember, live well"...The scenes of childhood lining together with Grandpa Delin have been constantly appearing in the mind of LEI. The elders who have embraced him and taught him have become the people that LEI cannot leave.""No, no -" lei kept shaking his headHe doesn’t want to believe that Grandpa Delrin really died.And it was the soul that died"Impossible, Grandpa Delrin, you come out. You come out.Lei watched Panlong's ring kept rammingAnd then it was even more pleading. Tears fell on the cold scales.Lin Lei's blood was constantly permeating, but lei felt nothing at all."Grandpa Delin” lei how to look forward to, and then there is a white light flying from the ring of dragons, into the white hair of the month of the white hair of the grandfather delinLei could not believe that grandfather delin was dead and left him so permanentlySince childhood with Grandpa DelinLei has never left with delin grandfather, never!

Lei raised his head and looked upThe sound reverberates between heaven and earth"whatAh..." lei knelt down and cried.However, regardless of how lei cried, but that honest old man is never coming againHe died forever"Grandpa Delin"LEI feels that she is weaker than ever. It is the weakness of the soul."There is no father, no mother, and even Grandpa Delin who has been with him is gone.The only one who stays with himself, but he simply does not know the existence of Bae Yee"The boss, the boss of lei” Bebe some shocked push leiLei back to look at babe“BebeLei suddenly beckoned babe in his arms“I’ve just shouted Grandpa Delrin, Grandpa Delrin, who was I?

Grandpa Delin will never be gone"Slightly ~~" Suddenly a brief burst of sound, lei turned to seeWhen I saw the deep pit in which I was rocked, I was struggling to climb outwards.Not only him, but five other people also climbed slowly from the ground.Meteorite Fall - Ground Curse MagicIf it is a Sanctuary Mage’s ‘The Rock Descent,’ these six people are 100% mortalBut Delrinkwater is a Sanctuary Magister who has no magic power.According to the principle of magic, magic is a general and elements are soldiers.Spiritual forces control the elements through magical powers, forming huge magic<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> is the soul of DrollkovoWith a huge amount of spiritual power to directly control the elements, the magic of the Earth’s rock falls directly.Because there is no magic powerEven Drinkovt burns the soulThe power of this rock-falling sky is only a normal or two percent of the power of the normal rockfall.But it's the power of the curse. It's also the six super deacons.Watching these six purple robes shadows are climbing hard outsideLei suddenly burst out endless anger, anger, unwilling"Ah--" The entire lei rushed to one of the purple-red figures like lightning. The super deacon saw lei rushed to scare his eyes and squatted."Ah--" LEI slams his hands and directly tears the super deacon into two halves."dead” lei to another purple robe figure directly to the head collapsed"Drink!" lei's claws directly on the chest of the third special deacon, grabbed his heart and pinched"DeathLei directly opened his mouth and bit his throat in the fourth special deacon, snapping his throatEat his meat and drink his blood! "whatLei physique suddenly went to the front of the fifth special deacon, already serious injury is not resistance to the special deacons only horrifiedly looked at lei to tear him from the thigh directly into two and a halfAs for the sixth deacon - "YouYou--"The sixth super deacon who has been seriously injured sees the dire situation ahead, and sees lei rushing in like a hell demon. He is shocked and trembles, and then the whole person falls.Even if this sixth superstar deacon is dead, lei is also hitting the other person's head with a fist and bursting his head completely.Bebe looked at this scene, some shockedThe soldiers who watched in the distance were completely aghasted. They did not expect that there would be such cruelty and horror.In particular, nowadays, the appearance of lei - the body scales are mostly fragmented and their blood is red.Dark gold pupil is faint red"Boss, you, what's wrong with you?" Bebe worriedAfter lei madly killed the six super deacons, the whole person was unable to sit on the ground.Sitting there, you don’t know what you’re thinking"The bossBebe anxiously to promote leiLei suddenly raised his head, tears can not help but flow downLei head down again, buried his head in his legs and even cried...The six giant pits, all within a few hundred meters, all become ruins.The six purple robes were completely brutally killed by a demonic monster.However, the demon geek buried his head in his legs and cried....

The friend froze and then nodded.People in the distance watching people, no one closeJust now, they have already seen the horror scenes of the fighting. That is, some of the 8th-level strongmen understand the gap between them and the other side.“The devil is crying?” Yale, Renault, George and other people who came from afar heard the commentary."Let's go, let's go!" Yale snarledThe escort of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce immediately pushed everyone onlookersYale, Renault and George three panicked and rushed towards the insideWhen they rushed to the innermost part, all three of them were froze - they were ruined within a few hundred meters of the radius, and the six huge pits could well imagine the horrors of that power.The six dead bodies can imagine the cruelty of the people who killed themAnd the devil, who had broken most of the scales, was sitting and crying.When you see Bebe next to the ‘devil’, especially the black halberds that are scattered on the groundYale three completely confirmed the identity of lei"The third"Yale, George, Renault three immediately rushed pastAt this time, Monroe & Dawson also rushed from the back and immediately ordered the opponent to say: “Let’s get rid of the six bodies and leave immediately.
