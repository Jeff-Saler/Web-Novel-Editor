The Magnolia Mainland’s largest inland river is undoubtedly the Magnolia River, the Magnolia River, the main road through the O'Brien Empire, the Magnolia Empire, the Roo Empire, and the Rhine Empire.Some of the branch rivers of the Magnolia River are even more densely populated in the regions of the four major empires of the Magnolia continent.It can be said that the Magnolia River nurtured the majority of the Magnolia mainland’s human population."Great rivers and rivers"LEI Lei is sitting on the deck of a large-scale building boat and watching the scene of the endless waters near the Magnolia River. It is very shocking in my heart."This boat is directly employed by leiSpend 10,000 gold coins, you can directly reach a river bank near the countyThe river bank is less than 100 miles from the countyAccording to lei, if we still follow the normal route, I am afraid that I will not know how many assassinations I will experience on the road.It would be better to directly hire a building boat and go straight along the Magnolia River to the south of the water.... But if Lin Lei is hired from a temporary start, lei would not think that the person on this floor would be the Lady of Widder.After all, around Blackrock City, the power of Mrs. Weed still has no effect.“Lee Brother"Jenny walked out of the cabinThe center of the river is very windy, boasting Gianni’s long dress and long hair.Jenny smiled and looked at lei. She walked beside lei and sat on the deck. “Lee Brother, I said at the time that I was spending 10,000 gold coins for you.” Jenny said that she was embarrassedFor Ginn and Kean, ten thousand gold coins are already a huge sum of money.Whoever thought that lei actually rented such a building directly, the price of such a large-scale building was very expensiveFrom Blackrock City to the city of Shire County, it takes 10,000 gold coins.This is the other side to see the black leopard next to Lin Lei, in order to express respect for such a strong lei, only to give a very low discount priceLei's commission '10,000 yuan'Only take a gold coin todayBut now I have paid 10,000 gold coinsIt's no wonder that Janey is embarrassed.Gianni's siblings want to pay, but unfortunately they have no money now"Jenny, don't you think that the scenery here is very good?" lei got up and walked to the top of the deck, with chains locked at the edge of the deck.Lei caress the iron chain and looks aroundTaotao Magnolia river water, tens of thousands of miles long, wide places are several miles wide, narrow places are also hundreds of meters wideThe entire motherland of the Magnolia mainlandI do not know how many people have been raisedThe history of Magnolia can be traced back hundreds of thousands of years."This Magnolia River has existed for at least hundreds of thousands of years."Looking at this Taotao Magnolia River, lei could not help but think of scenes hundreds of thousands of years agoWatching the vast Magnolia River, lei has also broadened his mind."Many people or countries for hundreds of thousands of years have long since disappeared.Compared with the change of history and the rise of the country, the individual's enmity has become so small."In the face of Weihe River, LEI has a special feeling“The Magnolia continent now stands with six monsters, four empires, the Holy See, and the Dark Holy See.Lei heart calm waveFrom childhoodLei's goal is to achieve the father's wishes, and there is the peak of cultivation.After his father's death, the entire soul of lei was in darkness, all the way to revenge, all the way to kill ... ... on this road, lei also lost grandpa delinThree years of hardships in the Mountain of Warcraft, naturally washing the soul, but it is to let lei feel like water, completely transformed into a butterfly“Climb the peak of cultivation to achieve the goalThe Holy See of LightDo you choose to retreat when faced with the King of Warcraft ‘Dili Lin’? " lei heart full confidence“One day, I will climb to the summitLei looked at the Tao Tao river, but it was ambitious******* The captain at the helm of this building is very relaxed. Although the water flow in the Magnolia River is swift, it is much safer than the ocean.He even chatted freely with the sailors on the side"Hey, did you see the black leopard?" The captain said proudly."That is Warcraft, you watched, my son will not be long before, will also receive a World of Warcraft""Captain, that's a leopard.Can your son receive it? "The sailor next to him laughed.The captain has little difference with the sailor's status. It is a group of men who are mixed on the water.The captain sighed: "Advanced Warcraft, I admire those who are strongI remember last year. When I went to the Imperial Capital, I saw Wu Shen Men Gate recruiting disciple disciples.You don't know, how many strong ones?Riding a giant Warcraft, or driving a flying World of Warcraft ... ... one by one strong have rushed over to compete for the only one placeIn those battles, the masters moved and I only saw a phantomToo fast, too fast"Sailors all began to boast that they had met those masters.In the O'Brien empire, almost every child wanted to be a strong player from an early age, and entering the martial arts gate became the biggest goal.... lei sat cross-legged on the deckIn spite of the gusty winds, the black cymbals are placed on their legs.Lei closed eyes quietly feel the magnolia river“The potential is the trend of the heavens, and it is the momentum of the earth. It is an endless trend."Lei's soul is fully integrated into the wind, and even sensed the vast river bed at the bottom of the Magnolia River, sensing the endless land around the Magnolia River."Naturally, it can also sense the turbulent riverThis ship is down the river and has been parked on the road for everyone to eat and so on.However, lei sat on the deck all the time and did not eat a meal.In an instant, six days have passed"Sister, Lei Dage, he doesn't eat or drink, is it all right?" Keane pointed at the lining sitting on the deck with his knees crossed and worried about asking Janey.Jenny also had some concerns in her heart. She shook her head and said helplessly: "I don't know, but that babe is not allowed to approach us.""Do not worry"The captain of the houseboat came over and said with a chuckle." Those top powerful people are not ordinary people like us. In front of them, the cliffs can't block them. <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle' );</script></div>, is that millions of troops also do not want to stop themI have heard of eating and drinking retreat for monthsAt their level, it's normal to eat or drink for months.The captain of the building said 'normal'However, there is still a trace of envy in the eyesGianni told Jean and said to the captain that he was extremely surprised in his heart.“Is that true?” Suddenly muttering to himself, Jenny, Keane and the captain of the ship all turned their heads. This was a shock to see them all.I saw lei holding the black tactical epee and actually jumped directly from the building boat towards the river water“Lee Brother"Jenny shoutedWhen the three of them immediately ran toward the front deck and ran to the chain, they were shocked to see that LEI was standing on the water with the black halberd epee.As the waters of Magnolia rise and fall, they do not sinkThis scene really made them stunnedFlying in the air, it must reach the sanctuary level before"Land, fire, water, wind..." LEI whispered in a low voice. At the same time, the epee in his hand suddenly spurted out of the sky. As the black halberd sword spurted upwards, it seemed as if the sky was punctured by a hole. Wailing noiseAt the same time, the water around Lin Lei’s body erupted directly toward the top.“Haha"I only heard lei laughed loudly, and then lin lei's figure in the surface of the magnolia river continue to make room for change, and the river also with lei's stature, epee roar constantly growlLei around 100 meters of water like madDozens of meters from the river at timesFrom time to time there is a large whirlpool, and sometimes the waters flow around like razor-sharp arrows. At times the water swirls around the lei...”"I heard only the sound of the epeeThe original crazy waters suddenly subsided, and in an instant, the Magnolia River resumed its original calm, only slightly ups and downs.Lei pedaling the river, but it is not sinking at allThis time, lei did not use wind magic to counteract the gravity of the black phoenix epee.But relying on the understanding of 'potentials' and the use of 'potentiality'“This 'trend' is the momentum of the world, and it is also the terrain of the earth.Lei smiled on his faceA little under the foot, the entire person jumped directly to the deck of the ship.For the realization of potential, lei has always started from the ground and wind.And this six-day retreat, it is to make lei feel the water fluctuations, lei also recalls the practice of fire magic, that element of fireHeavy, elegant, flexible, **Four elements fuse togetherSword out, it can cause heaven and earthThis is the real 'trend'. In the past, the ‘reality’ realized by lei was just a beginning.“Brother, you just, are you just now?” Kean was agitated but didn’t know what to say.That Jenny also watched lei with admirationWhat lei just did really made them stunned, that is, the captain of the building that has been running outside for a long time has not seen such an astonishing scene."It's just cultivationLei said with a smileAlthough the family recorded the book, the highest level of heavy weapon cultivation is the realm of the third ‘potential’, but lei feels like this.PotentialThis layer is not the endOn it, there isAfter reaching the level of 'trends', especially after integrating one's own soul with nature, there is always a feeling... There is still a higher level on it.Lei has the kind of vague feeling, but can not understand"Poppy, power is just a foundation, and how much attack power is exerted, this realm is an important partLei at the moment with this understandingFor example, there are millions of pounds of giant force, but when you attack, it is too clumsy.Only 10% of your strengthAfter penance, you may be able to use 30%MasterCan play 70%And what lei is trying to do is to use 10%, even with the help of heaven and earth, to exert a stronger attack than their own."Jenny, Keane, how long is it from the river bank?" lei asked"One day nowThe captain of the building, not far away, repliedLei nodded and said directly: "In this way, we do not need to dock on the bank closest to the county of ChinchWe docked at a river bank on the county of Shreshire."" Yes, Lei Daren"The captain of the building, although he did not understand the reason, may still beHoe lei walked the river, which made Lady Widder's man and horse suddenly in a mess, the red-haired man ‘kod’ eventually found out that a group of people in lei had hired a building boat to go through the magnolia river.The Na’ermo pharmacist is no exception. He can’t cross the hundreds of meters or even wider rivers and go straight to others.On the other people's boat, it is estimated that the other party will also doubt the Hormo Pharmacist'sSo, they can only wait and wait at the river bankBut...according to anticipation, this floor of the ship should arrive at the bank of the river.“What's the matter, should people arrive yesterday?” Hallmer’s pharmacist sat in a residential area next to the bank of the river."Hall ink master, please wait."Mrs. Navidh's men are also anxious.Suddenly the door of this dwelling house was suddenly opened, and one of Mrs. Weed's hands rushed in and said innocently: "Master Halmer, the group of people did not stop at the river bank, but at the last one. Riverbank stoppedThey have now arrived in the red sand town near the city of the county of Cheshire. It is estimated that they will arrive in the town of Shaell County tonight."" arrived this evening? ” Hallmore Pharmacist at a Glance"Quick, we start immediately“The Hormo-Pharmacist immediately ordered that this group of people immediately rushed back toward the town of Chil County.(Today's completion of two chapters
