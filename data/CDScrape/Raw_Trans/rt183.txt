Black Lu? Lei remembered this name"Black Lu, talk about how the various forms of your change are going on?" For this, lei is very puzzledThe black-printed clouded leopard nodded: "Master, because I am a dark system and a wind system.There are also two magic crystal nucleuses in the dark and the wind.In normal times, I was just like the beginning, and my defense, speed, and attacking power were balanced.""When I was dominated by the dark crystal energies, the volume became larger, the attack force became larger, and the speed dropped slightly."If you are based on the wind magic crystal nucleus, this is the current wind system form.FasterDefense is weak"Black-printed clouded leopard ‘Black Lu’’ honestly answeredLei ran awayThe original black-printed clouded leopard is a dark, wind-loving double-demonized Warcraft.The volume is larger than the dark line.
