Drake HotelLei, yale, george, and renault four casually sat on either side of a long table. On the dining table, there are more than a dozen of delicate dishes arranged in rows one by one. There are also quite a few wines and spirits next to them.The four brothers are drinking fruit wine at the moment talking about what happened during this time"LEI, you should go to the Mountain of Warcraft after conducting year-end testing last year. Last year, Dixie's test finally reached Level 6 magician, and you did not participate in the test at all.Someone said that you are not as good as Dixie. It's... Well, we know that you’ve actually reached the Level 6 Wizard Level.Renault said in aLei drink a glass of wine and smiledSix magician? Since I entered that rare state and carved out the work of “Dream Awakening,” ten days and ten nights, the spiritual power has increased, so that the spiritual power of LEI increased tenfold at a stretchMakes LEI jump directly from level 6 magician to level 7 magicianSingle calculation of spiritual power, lei's spiritual power should still be superior in the seven magician"You aren't the oldest, you don't know the third. He doesn't care about this kind of thing.If you care about it, then each year's grade will not stop playing."Yale smiled and said, "Yes, my youngest. When this semester began, your Uncle Hillman came to school."Lei meal, looking to Yale, immediately asked: "Uncle Hillman, what's the matter? "In the past, lei went back to the New Year every year. Only this time, Lin Lei spent the winter and spring in the Warcraft Mountains."Nothing, it is estimated that you did not go back to the New YearWhat are you worried about?"Yale said to himself, and then he continued," Right.One thing I must tell you is that on the day your Uncle Hillman arrived, the chief curator of the Prussian Guild Hall also came in, for your stone carving, 'Dream Awakening'.Lei thrilled: "The chief curator? How could he know that my stone carving work 'Wake up'? At this time, Renault said with embarrassment: "It all blames me. When Yale sent people to transport your stone carvings from Houshan, I thought no one else knew about the preciousness of this stone sculpture.Was placed in the dormitoryFrom time to time you can enjoyHowever, he did not think that he had found him directly and found our dormitory directly. He just saw your stone ‘waking up’ and later told him about the existence of the ‘wake up’ to the director of the Maia Museum.Lei nodded slightly"LEI, that chief curator also wanted you to auction this stone carving 'Wake up'? That is not to auction, but also want to put this 'wake up' in the Prouks Hall to the exhibition. Did you promise?" Yale looked LeiLei shook his head without hesitation“I don’t want to let the ‘wake up’ to the public at the moment, and I’m not short of moneyFor lei, ‘wake up’ represents his feelingsOf course, after sculpting 'wake up'Lei's mood has changedEspecially in the Mountain of WarcraftAfter experiencing numerous siege of the Misty Valley, under the ground, I saw that the two Super World Wars were killing each other, even dying. In particular, I had swallowed dragon blood and successfully became a Dragon Blood Warrior.Experienced it allFor leiThe memory of Alice was already far awayLei also understandCherishing the eyes is the most important“If my father knew that I could carry out 'Longhua', I would be very happyLei thought of his fatherHogg has always been looking forward to his son's ability to become a Dragon Blood WarriorLittle Wharton's Dragon Blood Warrior reached a sufficient concentration, and lei can now be longEven after Longhua reached the ability to enter the eighth gradeIf this news tells Hogg that both of his sons can become dragon blood warriors, Hogg will be very excited and very proud of it.Lei can also guess the value of stone ‘waking up’. He also understands that if such a large stone carving is placed in wushan town, it is absolutely insecure.So lei also asked Yale to help keep the ‘wake up’ stone carvingFor the large Dawson Chamber of Commerce, this is a breezeOut of the hotel, four lei walk on the tree-lined road"Yale boss, second child, fourth child, there is one thing I must tell youLei pondered for a moment and saidSee lei so serious, Yale, George, Renault three people can not concentrate"I'm ready to apply for graduation just in these daysLei hard to say thisGraduation means leaving the Ernst Magic School and leaving these three good brothersLin Lei entered the Ernest School of Magic from the age of nine, and is now seventeen years old. He is also eight years old.The brothers who live in the most pristine eight years of life are utilitarian and truly good brothers.Lei can not bear their own brotherBut life is alive. After all, it's time to do something.Once you graduate, your nobility, seal, army, etc. will come.It’s time for you to advance boldly."Graduation?" Yale, George, and Renault were all shocked. Yale first responded and said: "The youngest, why are you dying to graduate? What good is it from graduating from Ernst College? Our four brothers Isn't it great together? And Ernst College is much calmer than outside"George and Renault also quickly persuadedLei shook his head and said: "No, we can't hide in Ernst College and we don't contact the outside world."" The youngest, you are only six magician, six magician on the outside although it can be considered a masterBut it's a lot better than youIt's better ... you practice to a level 7 magician, and then graduate no later."George proposedIn the eyes of George et al., the magician practice has two large hurdles. The largest hurdle is from the Nine Magician to Sanctuary, and the second hurdle is from the Sixth Magician to the Seventh Magician.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Class 9 magician to the sanctuary, even if the mental power is enough, even if the magic power is strong, even if it takes a long time Years; <from the sixth level magician to the seventh level magician, even genius characters generally need more than ten years of effort"I have reached Level 7 magicianLei directly said"Seven magicians?" The Yale trio was completely stunned by the thunderbolt.Dixie’s genius was only sixteen years old when he reached the level six magician. If he reaches seven magicians, he is very hard, at least until the age of thirty.And lei is only 17 years old this year! "The youngest, you said you reached the seventh magician?" Yale simply can not believe"The youngest, don't defraud usGeorge refused to believeRenault is staring at leiWithout saying a word"Hey ~ ~" lei on the shoulders of lei is inevitably cried, kept yelling at Yale three people, lei would have heard the sound of beibei inequality: "boss, these three guys do not believe youBoss, get a seven magician to let them tasteLei glanced at babe: "babe, don't make trouble"Bebe's pretending to 'grievance' to see lei, do not say anything"This babe, the performance ability is getting strongerLei smiled in the heart, and then looked to their three good brothers: "yale bossDon't believe itWhen I go to apply for a graduating tomorrow, you will see the test."Yale, George, Renault all know that lei is a man, knowing that he is not the kind of person who will lie"The youngest, did you really achieve it?" George asked softlyLei nodded slightly: "or else, let me show you flyLei began to read magic spells, while the three yalu are watching quietly on the sideAfter a while, the airflow around the body of lei surroundsAt the same time, lei floated upLEI floating height is not highAbout twenty centimeters from the groundIf people in the distance don’t look carefully, they’ll never notice"This is a flotationSaid RenaultFloatation is straight up and down flight"See clearly” lei suddenly the entire person flew toward the sky at a high speed, flying about 10 meters and then fell rapidlyYou can stop when you fall 20 centimeters from the groundKeep that kind of suspensionTo maintain this state for a moment, LEI landed"Aviation?" Yale really shocked three peopleAlthough this scene of the lei performance is very simple, but it is clearly expressedThe ability to fly diagonally in the sky is absolutely ‘flying’"Hey, lei, long time no see, did not expect to just see you, you just jump in this show ah"A young man from the distance walked in with a smile. lei's actions just looked from a distance, it is indeed a jump.For a strong warrior, jumping 10 meters is not a problemAnd most people in Ernest College know that this genius of lei is not only a magician, but also a powerful warrior.Someone once saw with his own eyes that he could easily lift a nearly a thousand pounds of rock from Hou Shan to the dormitory.Lei and yalu also greeted people, they were a friend of their dormitory next door."The youngest, you really reached the level 7 magician. This, how is this possible? But I just?" George whispered in the first breath."Seven-year-old seven-level magician, God, ah, we have such a powerful genius in the history of Magnolia mainland?" Renault also excitedYale looked at the lei and his eyes were bright: "I have a little expectation when I graduated from junior high school."...the next morning, more than thirty magic teachers gathered here on an open space where the Ernst Magic School experimented with magic.In fact, only four magicians are enough for the graduation test. But there is nothing in the teachers of the Ernst Magic School. They have heard that Lin Lei has applied for graduation.After all, the average student has reached Level 6 magician. After studying in the sixth grade, he will apply for graduation. In that case, there is no need to perform any further tests.So graduation tests are still scarceMore than thirty magic teachers and three students of Yale, George, and RenaultOf the 30 or so magicians, there are Drake, the vice dean of the college who runs idly and idly. According to Delant, "One of the two geniuses in our college is going to apply for a graduation. Of course, I have to look"" "LEI Lei, you use the magic of the ground to 'gun the gun', according to the size of the gun and the scope of the gun burst, we can determine your magic level"One of the magicians who conducted the test saidIf it reaches the sixth level, it will naturally be judged to be able to graduateLei shook his head slightlyThe group of onlookers and magical teachers could not help but be puzzled. Vice President Delant even persuaded: "LEI, aren't you applying for graduation, how?" "I want to use wind magic.Lei said with a smileDelant and other vice presidents all laughed. They all know that lei is a double-edged wind and can detect the strength of the magician. The main test is the spiritual power.No matter which line is detected, it is the same to determine the strength of mental strength."Then you use it"Deputy Delant and more than 30 magic teachers laughed at leiLei immediately meditation from the seven magic spells 'flight' magic spell, when the meditation for a while, the air flow began to be surrounded by lei, lei suddenly suspended everyone up and then in the air elegantly wanton flight, sometimes turning, sometimes dive , sometimes flying at speed"Flying, flying?" Three dozen magical teachers are stunned. They understand what level of flight is."Seven-year-old seven-level double magician, this..." Delant's vice president knew at once, and for a long time, the Ernst Magic School probably would not be able to calm for a while.
