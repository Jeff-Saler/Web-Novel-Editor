"His Majesty?" lei looked at the pastThe golden middle-aged man in golden glamorous armor and body with a lion-like blond hair turned out to be the king of the Kingdom of Finlay.And it's still a powerful nine-level strongman who is simply incredibleAs a member of the Kingdom of Finlay, lei had heard about the pride of the Kingdom of Finlay — the legend of the Golden Lion Clyde — long ago that a king of the kingdom was still a super power, which would undoubtedly make the kingdom The people are extremely proud and proudIn the square in front of the Temple of Light, hundreds of thousands of people stood in an orderly manner.In front of the angel statue, bright popes, archbishops, priests, knights, and other groups of people stood quietly. The bright pope that was surrounded by them was undoubtedly the most dazzling.The six royal families of the Holy Alliance and the Grand Dukes of the Principality are all standing still.Suddenly - with the pope as the center, a clear and visible milky ripple spreads out, and there is a silence on the square where hundreds of thousands of people suddenly gather. Almost all people have a quiet smile on their faces, and the peace of mind is unprecedented."It is so horrible to send so many lighters covering hundreds of thousands of people so easily." lei as a magician, but can see the pope's powerfulThe entire square quietly heard only the breeze"In the name of the Lord!" said the bright Pope quietly, but the sound rang through the world and shocked the soul.Everyone on the court felt that there was a threat from Pope Pope. LEI was also respectful and unrelenting. This pressure was stronger than the two Sanctuaries that LEI had encountered in the town of Wushan. And the threat of Warcraft 'Black Dragon' is even more horrificThis kind of coercion does not require oppression, but it makes people worship from their souls.God's coercion! In addition to the bright pope in the entire square, hundreds of thousands of other people, from the archbishop of Red, to the kings of the six kingdoms, went down to the common people to respect and listen to the instructions one by one."May the Lord's love, grace, and gifts be with you"The pope's voice does not seem to be large, but it rang through the world and shocked the soul."A holy ray of light rippled from the tip of the temple of the Great Temple of God and covered everyone. Almost everyone on the field felt a quiet heart and the body had reached a state of unprecedented goodness.Everyone is very respectful"May the Lord give you grace and peaceAt the same time, the bright pope exudes a peaceful glory. "The Lord's people, let us confess our sins, and repent in our own thoughts, deeds, words, and errors. May the Lord pity us, forgive our sins, and let us eternal life"Suddenly, a holy chanting sounds throughout the heavens and the earth, and all the worshippers of the Shrine of the Light also earnestly chanted. The chants of the believers and the chants of the heavens and the earth echoed each other. All were sincere and respectful."... The process of mass is very complicated, from repentance to compassion, to glory, to prayer, then to gratitude, and finally to singing.Most of the people in the square are believers in the Holy See. Most people are immersed in the glory of the Temple of Light.Even those who did not believe in the Temple of Light were driven by the atmosphere of the scene. When the chanting was over, everyone was fully awake and it was already at noon.Mass was over and people on the court left in an orderly mannerLei together with Alice walked hand in hand to walk together: "lei big brother, how do you feel? is not very comfortable?" lei shook his head: "feeling was affected by the atmosphere, the whole person can not maintain absolute sober, absolute autonomyPeople who may not rely on the heart will like this feeling very much, but I do not like it, I do not like to be affected by other"I have to admit that in the process of mass, lei was indeed affected, and the feeling of ease even made lei indulgeAfter all, the fact that Lin can come from the battle of life and death in the Mountain of Warcraft will make him wake up.It was also scared to think about it.

The city of Finlay was a holy capital. Every year the 'Magnolia Festival' held such a large mass. Most of the residents of the Holy Capital were believers of the Temple of the Light. Alice was a child. It is not so easy to change the spiritual beliefs of the Holy See."Alice, you can't think that way. Isn't it your own hard work that you do today? How can it be the Lord's grace? Since the Lord has graced you, why did you let you have such a father?

LYN looked at Alice away, but with some irritability in her heart. She looked back at the towering light shrine: "This is a bright Catholic church, it is indeed not harmful."”************************************************************************************************************ The quarrel between young men and women is also quite common. When the second time, Lin Lei met with Alice, her feelings were awful.Both of them were interested in evading the issue of faith. When they saw it twice a month and when they fell in love, they even saw it four times in January. The two were even sleeping together, but they still did not break through.
