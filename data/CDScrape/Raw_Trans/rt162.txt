There are two guests on the inside who are watching the weaponry that the weapons shop provides for people to watch. However, Lin Lei went directly to the counter and said indifferently: “Hess City, who has the most capable refining weapons?” The waiter inside the counter took a look at Lin Lei wearing it. The man in front of him was actually a magician. He immediately said respectfully: “Master of magicians, this ability to make weapons, the strength of Potter’s master in our weapons store is very high.There are no weapons he can't make""I'm asking, who is the strongest weapon in the Hess City? Lei cold face down, "if I asked for weapons, your so-called master Potter, can not manufacture, don't blame me to marry you this shop"The waiter was scared by lei. Originally he wanted to solicit business, and he dared not blow it away:" Respect the Magi Master, we are the first Master of Hess City, is in the west city of Hess City, beside the Temple of Light is not Kirby at the Far Arms Shop"" Kirby?

According to the investigation by lei yesterday, a group of sacred strongmen such as the Holy See of the Holy See did not come to Hess City.I heard that only one red cardinal came to Hess CityCoordinate the King of the Kingdom of Hess together to arrange troops at the borderAs for the Holy Powers of the Holy See, they did not know where they were."I really hope that the King of Warcraft will kill several sacred strong people.Lei heart underground channel, that the light of the Holy See 'haitingsi' to lei to display 'God's beloved', although lei do not understand the effect of 'God's beloved,' but that God's coming 'forces of faith' should actually be integrated into their own soulsoulThis is the most important and most important place, lei is sure that Haitings has no good intentions"This is the so-called Hess City First Master Master weapons shop to stay?" lei looked at the front of the weapons shop, this weapons shop store is a few tens of meters long, there are two brave and brawny outside wearing Gorgeous armorStanding on the sides of the shop with weaponsThis weapon shop is very imposingIt was obviously a lot higher than the one she had recently entered.Into the weapons shop, the waiter in the weapons shop are beautiful women, the maid saw lei dressed immediately and ran up with eyes, politely said: "respective magician adults, do not know what you want weapons, you Come with me, look here, we have a variety of gorgeous palace swordsLei laughedIt seems that the maid takes herself as a kind of pure magician."I heard about KirbyIn yours?

The maid smiled a bit embarrassingly. "Master of magician, Master Kirby never takes the initiative to meet the guests. To meet Kirby, you can only find him."And... to see the master Kirby, it takes some money, otherwise I don’t see it.Lei had to admit that this colby is indeed a great shelf"it is goodHow many gold coins do I go to him? Lei directly said"Not much, fifty gold coins"The maid even saidFifty gold coins are nothing for some affluent aristocrats, but this price is enough for ordinary civilians to work for a couple of years."Fifty?" lei took out a bag of gold coins from her arms. There were 100 gold coins in this bag of coins. lei poured out fifty, and he directly ordered the road. "You lead the way.""Lin Lei usually only bring 100 coins with the otherThere is also a magic crystal card on the body."YesMagician adults"The maid is glad to be very......Five minutes later, lei walked down to a simple mansion led by a maid. The janitor at the mansion apparently knew that the maid was directly released.When lei saw the master of Kirby, the Kirby was lying in a chair and quietly drinking teaThis Kirby's hair has gone white, but his whole muscles are very obvious, obviously a powerful warrior.General master masters are very fierce warriors“Master Kirby, this magician wants to see youThe maid respectfully saidMaster Kirby looked to lei and laughed: "Young people, my asking price is very high.To make a weapon, the starting price is 10,000 gold coins"<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>LEI is able to sense the approximate strength of Kirby's eyesNot a 7th-level warrior, or a 8th-level warrior"canLei nodded, "but this piece of weapon, to provide materials, right, others leave first, can you?
