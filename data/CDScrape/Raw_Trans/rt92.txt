Gradually, lei discovered the exit of the underground passageway and took out the faint red light at the exit.Suddenly - ‘‘HahaSadiez, aren't you arrogant? Three hundred years you did to me, today I will redouble my return"The sound of a strong voice came from the exit, and it sounded as if it were thunderousLEI was not surprised: "Someone!" "But humans are at least as good as World of Warcraft.And I have no other way to go, but this person's voice is really big"Lei Lei slowly approached the wall of the passage, when he walked 20 meters from the entranceLei can already see the scene outside the cave through the hole that is more than ten meters wide.The end of this passageIs a very large underground caveThis cave is at least a few miles away and it is tens of meters high.However, lei suddenly froze - lei can clearly see this point of view, a foot full of ten meters tall, body hair like a steel-like big black bear volley, this big black bear body surface has a trace of purple, Looks like a monsterThis big black bear standing in the air is talking about human discourse"This, this" lei breathed a breathIn my mind, it seems like a flashPanlong Forum "Sacred World of Warcraft!" lei instantly understandOnce World of Warcraft reaches Sanctuary LevelYou can fly in the air, but you can also vomitThese are the characteristics of the Sanctuary of WarcraftSanctuary is very scary.The general human sacred strong is no match for Sanctuary.Only the top sacred strongman has enough strength to kill the Sanctuary of Warcraft.Sanctuary of Warcraft, the volume can easily become smallerA celestial dragon can be turned into a snakeOf course...
