Below the white mist linger, standing at the top of the canyon cliff can not see what is belowLei hand holding a flat knife, standing next to the misty canyon looking down, this shank knife is lei to spend three thousand gold coins to build, and its sharp and tough degree than the past that handle black short blade is also stronger on manyAfter all, for the LEI, the flat knife is more smoothly than the black short blade.Lei has entered the mountains of war for a month and a half, self-perceived state is adjusted to the bestIntricately, the elements of the system converged with lei's magic spells next to lei's side, and finally formed a seemingly simple armor. When you look closely, you can discover that the armor is made of jade, but this armor has an element of geography.The ground is seven levels of magic - the earth guardian holy shrine (yushijie) seven magician, comparable to six magician is much more powerful, and the defense power has increased nearly ten times"Now I meet the Wingbird Dragon again. With this jade sacred sword alone, you can easily withstand their attacks."lei is also very confident in the heart, and then lin lei also recalled flying magic spells, air around the lei around the body, finally lei floating into the misty canyonFor exploring the fog valley, lei is still very confident“I now have a jade armor defense and flying skills, plus I’m also a 4th class warrior myself. With the 7th level of 'speed', there is no problem with self-protection." lei probe this fog valley, not impulsiveBut because ... ... blue heart grass! Blue heart grass is too important for lei, in addition to blue heart grass, lei is also very curious, in the end what is the reason why so many World of Warcraft gathered hereIn particular, different types of Warcraft gather in the same valley."Boss, be careful, don't forget to be chased after the last time” Bebe’s soul voice said"rest assured"The more you fly down, the greater the distance between the cliffs on both sides, the clear below the valley is amazingly wide."In the day-to-day water mist, the lei flew very carefully, carefully observed all directions, and Babe watched with extreme care. They also observed where there was bluegrass.The first destination of the lei is naturally the location of the blue heart that was not picked last time.Advancing carefully against the cliff lei"Boss, I see blue heart grassjust in front"Bebe's eyes are very powerful, lei looked atSuddenly eyes brightGrass green, vaguely with a blue halo flowing in it"There will be no green giants" lei can not be carelessAlthough the green giant is not afraid, but once killed with a green giant, it is easy to lead other Warcraft, he can no confidence to deal with the entire Warcraft armyGreen pythons are green, and they are ignored if they are not careful when they are over green cliffs. Therefore, LEI requires one hundred times of caution.Watch carefully for a while and make sure there are no green giants among the green Fujimen.Lei this carefully flew pastPicking this blue heart grassGet cold, LEI's face shows a smileThis is a feature of the blue-hearted grassland, and LEI carefully put this bluegrass into its own parcel.And then continue to explore slowly"Hey ~ ~ ~" "Hey ~ ~ ~" all kinds of World of Warcraft roar from the bottom of the cry, cluttered shouting lei made a heartThose snoring sounds come from all directions below, and can be judged simply by buzzing. Lei through the white mist, already vaguely see the rich grass"Boss, be careful, I don't want to be chased everywhereBebe reminded"I know" lei's vigilance mentioned the highest, with his eyes carefully watching around, especially those who rely on the precipice to the vine, lin lest there are green giants hiding in those FujimanDiscovered by a Warcraft, it is equal to being discovered by a group of Warcraft."Is it a dragon?Lei discovered that a distant large-scale flight of flying arbitrarily flew casually and quickly flew away.Fortunately, there is a white mist in the canyon, and if you are too far away, you can only see it in a vague manner.The wing bird is very large and easy to observe, while lei's body size is much smaller than that of Warcraft, and naturally takes a slight advantage."Hey, hey ~ ~ ~" suddenly a burst of strange sounds, and officially approached this position in the direction of lei"not good” lei face changeThe lion had a close contact with the winged bird dragon. It was clear that this sound was the cry of the winged bird dragon. Lin Lei looked at the source of the sound and saw only about twenty or thirty huge winged bird dragons. Stylus flew over hereThe wing bird shape is too big, twenty or thirty flying together, it is simply overwhelming.So many bird wings, lei almost nowhere to hideNow, lei has three choices. One is to directly fight these winged bird dragons, and the other is to fly directly to the top.The third ... is flying at a rapid speed, directly into the valley"Look!" lei did not hesitate to fly directly down the past, the white mist blowing, leap several times the time lei just as the same arrow directly into a lush weeds, and then motionless Mantle inside the weedsLei marched carefully until the edge of the weeds, carefully watching the valley through the cracks of the weeds.This is a very wide valley with rivers inside and lush weeds. It looks like a hideaway.However, in this 'Xinhuayuan', there is a group of huge reptilesTwo stories tall, with a volume of thirty meters long, it resembles a rock-like scale, and each scale has a half-sizeLei naturally emerged in the mind of the relevant information: "Landwalking, six World of Warcraft, fire"<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "If there is only one dragon, this is not terrible, but..." Sweep, "The number of dragons in these places is absolutely over 100, and if more than one hundred dragons are rushed to kill, they can't resist at all.""But they are not fast enough to threaten meLei sees other WarcraftIn the valleyThe dragons on the ground are just a small force because there are a large number of 'raptors'. The raptors are not gregarious. Most of them are scattered throughout the valley, and sometimes the birds fly through the sky.If you look closely, there are some large pythons swimming in the distant grass.This is just what lei sees"A brief observation can at least be judged that the valley is east-west and north-south direction can obscure the cliffs.Lei looked backIn the distance to the west, cliffs can be seen, but the east can't be seen clearly.There is a river with somethingWater is constantly flowing from the east"Bebe, you are also careful to observe"LEI has applied wind-assisted magic to his own speed." Then the entire man carefully wandered through some weeds. The weeds in this valley are very lush and may be related to these animals.In the process of sneaking down, lei suddenly noticed a little“A good dense element of heaven and earth, where the density of the world’s elements is at least sixty-seven times that of the outside world.Lei has been in tension since entering the valleyEven this did not notice at first"This is a dense world elementWhat is the cause of the ground? Lei carefully sneaked towards the east, in this valleyWhether it is a dragon, a raptor, a green eagle, or a winged bird dragon, all of them are physically active and large, and lei is a sneak peek at one meter or more high weeds."This valley is long enough!" lei headed east for about twenty miles and still found no end of the valley.At the same time, Lin Lei also discovered the new WarcraftSix World of Warcraft - Wings Pegasus, 7 Warcraft - Lei Yi PegasusVarious wings of Pegasus fly over the sky, and some walk in the valley, eating grass weed"Boss, there's very little weeds here.So what? Babe worry aboutLin Lei also wrinkled his brows, a large number of weeds in front of the relatively small, if any, it is estimated that only one leg high"With such a long distance, it will certainly not be able to pass from the ground. It will only come from above.Lei cautiously back, after about a few hundred meters back, after a long distance away from the Pegasus group, lei immediately display flying“Call!” Flying at a speed directly above, LEI suddenly burst into the thick white mist over the sky. In the white fog, only occasionally there was a PegasusAfter all, this winged Pegasus is relatively small and occupies little space. LEI can still avoid it.While carefully flying towards the east, lei was also close to the cliffs on the south side and carefully observed whether there were blue hearts on the cliffs. However, with the advancement, LEI’s brows were also wrinkled. “In addition to starting a blue heart grass, No one has been found until now" lei heart some eagerHowever, the lei still continued to advance toward the east. After flying for more than ten years, lei found no wingspans in the sky and landed down."LEI, this type of World of Warcraft is very complicated. Most of this is not gregarious World of Warcraft, such as the Raptor, such as black bears, such as that flexible panda"Drincowwater also floats beside LEI and goes along with LEI.Lei cautiously sneaked, but delin kowtor walks easily"ah!" lei as if the entire person is like thunder and lightning, looking at the front innocentlyJust about 50 meters in front of lei, there is a grass field of seven or eight meters, and the elderly person on the grass is a green grass.Green grass is not unique, strange is ... ... these grasses have a blue glow flow"Blue heart grass, are blue heart grass!" At this moment, lei's heartbeat are fixed, and God, a blue heart grass worth tens of thousands of gold coins, or there is no market priceHowever, at the distance of 50 meters ahead, there are at least a few hundred strains of blue heart grass on the seven or eight meters of grass."So much, one hand is seven or eight strains.Lei took a deep breathDelin Kewot also eyes shining: "LEI Lei, live dragon blood, it is estimated that four or five bluegrass is enoughSo many blue hearts are simply unthinkableBut... this blue heart grass is surrounded by a bare groundHow did you go by? May be bluegrass, which is inconsistent with ordinary weedsAround the blue heart grass, the radius is bare for nearly 30 meters and there is no weed."World of Warcraft here is not too much, and it is not gregarious, disorganized everywhere.Lei watched carefully around the surrounding environment, "none of the seven World of Warcraft close to this blue heart grass, as long as I speed, escape is still confidentLei strives to calm his state of mind"Boss, you're stupid, forget me babe?" Bebe suddenly voiced the soul saidLei a moment, look to babe, babe proudly blinked at lei: "boss, my speed is much faster than you, and my volume is much smallerWhen I go picking, there is no problem at all. You just open the parcel and wait for it.""call out! "A black afterimage, blink of an eye, babe took to the middle of the blue heart grass lawn, and then the little paws flexibly and mercilessly plundered the blue heart grass, two small paws waving, that grassy The central area suddenly became bare and piled up next to the blue heart grass 'big haystack' with babe.
