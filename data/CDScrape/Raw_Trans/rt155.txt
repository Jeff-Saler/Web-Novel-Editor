Among the secluded courtyards of the palace, there are important figures of the King of Finlay, Clyde, his many wives, and many children gathered here."The entire city of Finlay is full of Warcraft. It must not be crowded together. It will only attract some superpowers."Clyde said with seriousness, this truth is understood by many people."This is why the chief curator of Maia, Monroe & Dawson have only a few cavalry troops.Dozens of individual teams can be seen everywhere in the city of Finlay.But if it is a team of several hundred people, I am afraid that those nine World of Warcraft, even the Sanctuary of Warcraft may be noticed, maybe they will kill it.At this moment, attracting the attention of Warcraft is the most important"Carre, you and your mother, start with a squadronThere are five Masterless Magic Cards here. Remember, this is the wealth that our royal family has accumulated for thousands of years! Clyde said gravely to his oldest son.There are too many royals to go in batchesClyde does not want the royal family to overthrow, they go in batches, and the royal family has a higher probability of success."Yes, Father"Carly's heart is overjoyedThousands of years of accumulation, what a tremendous wealth"Shak, you and your mother, your sister, and you start off with a squadron.There are also five Masterless Magic Cards hereClyde also took out five magic crystal cards and handed them to his second son.The two princes are excitedClyde said gravely: "Our royal family's elite are divided into three groups. Carre, Shaq, and I. No matter who lives last, we can at least guarantee that our family will not be destroyed.Okay, start now! CaesarYou as the instructor of the Berserker Squadron, follow meClyde looked to Caesar"Yes, Your MajestyCaesar noddedThe Kuanglei Squadron is the most powerful royal guard squadron of the Kings of Finlay. The entire Kuai Lei Squadron and Caesars are 100 and each team also has thirty-three.The number is scarce, this quality is naturally extremely highAmong the 100 people, the weakest one is the 7th-level soldier.The Finlay royals immediately divided into three teams and fled from three directions.******"Oh!" LEI leaps quicklyAt the same time the demon off the ground purple light flashed, the lightning that continued to send LEI attack Lei Lei was halved by the lei into two halves, and then lei shuttle again and again on the way to the palaceOn this road, there are too many dead bodies and bodies of Warcraft."The palace is hereLei leap, the whole person is turned into a residual image, every move has tens of metersThis amazing speed also makes most of the five or six levels of Warcraft can not attack lei"callLei easily leaps more than ten meters into the interior of the palace"Hey ~ ~" The entire palace was ringing with the roar of Warcraft and the soldiers shouted and killed.There is no guard at the gate of the palace at this moment. There are only ground meat, blood, and bodies.Occasionally, there is a huge body of Warcraft.Lei is like a civetGently jumping in the building complex of the palaceWhen Lin Lei jumped to the roof of a house, suddenly saw a cavalry team in the distance, no one would have used the carriage when he fled.The speed of the carriage is too slow"That was..." lei recognized the central blond man at one glance. It was Clyde who was known as the "Golden Lion".Clyde is directing the team to kill the World of Warcraft that attacked them around.This cavalry team is very cleverA group of elites consisting of 7th-level fighters and 8th-level fighters, once combined, are more efficient than a disorganized group of 8th-level fighters.ClydeLei eyes bright"Boss, let's get started” Bebe is also excited"Wait a minute, we have to surprise ourselves this time. When their cavalry troop goes near us, we come to a surprise attack.Lei the whole person leaned on the roofA pair of eyes staring coldly at cavalry troops not far away... "don't waste time, fast"The great sword in the hands of Clyde was also a sword that drove down a dragon from the air.For most of this month, Clyde had refined a little ‘hemolytic poison’, making him able to use one-tenth vindictiveness.Although only one tenth, it also made him possess the power of an eight-level warrior.However, there are 90% of hemolytic poisons, Clyde estimated that it will take half a year"So much Warcraft in the endAssholeClyde wants more and moreThese warships destroyed his king, now it is even more a threat to his life. How can he not be angry? "fast"After killing the beasts that siege them, Clyde immediately hurried again and the cavalry team accelerated again.At this time, Clyde and a group of people ran in the streets of the palace, but they did not notice that they were standing on the roof above the front wall.Lin Lei looked closer and closer to Clyde's party and his eyes fell.Babe body hair is also erected"This is the time!" lei's voice sounded directly in Bebe's mind, one person and one beast flew from the roof to ClydeIn the Fei Fei's coffin, LEI appeared on the surface of the entire black scales, and the forehead, babe, elbows and knees also showed spikes.At the coccyx there is also a steel tailFull dragon! This group of cavalry troops is indeed an elite. When lei and babe have just emerged, they react.Unfortunately, lei, babe speed too fast! "Ah, it's you"Clyde saw the incoming person's horror appearance, all of a sudden it was determined that the incoming person was lei! It was too late to think why lei hadn't died. The lei's tail had already been pumped over, and his body was only one or two meters away." distanceAnd Caesar behind him was also tangled up with the black shadow rat, and it was too late to save him.“啪!” 林雷龙尾 ran without mercy, Clyde directly plunged down.Lei's dragon's tail is drawn on Clyde's mountThe horse was shot by Lin Lei, and the body that was directly extracted by <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> was broken into two pieces.The sadness and anger of the horse whispered, and Clyde fell to the groundAt the same time with both hands up, speed after the jumpAnd lei continues to chase"嗤嗤--" Almost at the same time, the eight-handled rifle sparkling at the same time stabbing lei"Drink!" lei body dragon vindictiveness broke out, the right foot is a look at the groundThe momentary impact of the whole person reaches its maximum, like a boulder that is ejected to go to the ground.Lei's body slammed on an eight-barrelled gunThe eight-barrel lances fluttered almost at the same time. The eight-stranded vibrating force almost completely counteracted the impact of the lei."troubleLei brow creaseHe didn't think that the eight knights were so simple that they blocked their impact.Not enough lei do not know, that eight knights are more scaredThe eight of them are Clyde's personal guards. They are the most elite part of the Kuanglei team. These eight people are all eight strong players.The eight of them will be able to block the 9 strong players.Can be nine strongDo not dare to hit their gunpoints, lei is dare"A good abnormal defense"At this moment, hiding in the distance, Clyde was shocked by a dozen knights."Hey ~ ~" Bebe is a wailing scream, and that claws are squished to CaesarSometimes using that tooth to biteCaesar’s whole person is very chic and constantly uses his great sword to block Babe’s attack.Caesar uses a sword, simple but effectiveA step backward, a sword, it is hard to resist"Clyde, who can I help you today?" lei took a look at these powerful fighters and sneered."Well, aren't you going to attack the group?" Lin immediately said, and the entire person immediately rushed to one of the knights.Lei is not afraid of other knights' attacks, only to spot a knight attackAt this time, their coups had no effect."callLei speed is too fast, and soon came to a tier 8 knight in front of lei's claws slammed to the knight's face, this knight a back, and lei's tail is suddenly The ground will be drawn directly to the cracking of this knight’s head."Saar!!!" Many knights shouted indignantly.This crazy Lei Squadron team members have been training together, feelings comparable to the brothersMany knights rushed to lei with angerEven if angry, but they still naturally cooperate with each other, giant swords, spears attack"Hey!" lei suddenly appeared in the hands of purple blood sword, lei regardless of the attack, directly close to a knight, while the purple blood sword directly pierced a knight's eyesPierced the headMakes the other person die on the spot"Death"Another knight angrily stabbed lei with a pistolLEI's backhand Zixuejian suddenly slammed into the past, when the Cavalier attempted to block it, the Zixuan Sword actually easily cut a Knight's head around the bend.No blood-thirsty Zionist can easily kill the 7th-level warrior, but now he instills the blood-spirited Purple Blood Sword, which is not difficult to kill the 8th-level warrior.Strange! Eight fighters, three dead in an instant"I see how you block!" lei jumped and rushed towards Clyde. The purple exoskeletons in the hands of the monster were constantly flashing. No knights dared to approach the lei.Because the lion's sword in the hands of lei escapes the demon."Hey ~ ~" suddenly heard from the distance"Hey, hey, hee hee..." The heavy pace soundedThere is such a fierce pace of sound can be imagined is a huge body of Warcraft, and that huge Warcraft is constantly approaching hereLei ignored it all“Stop and block him!” Clyde shouted, and at the same time he continued to retreat. Lin leaped slammed at him. At the same time, on the wall, the whole person rushed towards Clyde.When Caesar saw this scene, he instantly saw the ground. The whole person turned into a graffiti."bring it onLei ignored this sword, the purple blood sword in his hand directly to clyde"Last time there was a holy magical scroll to save you, and Hittings to save youI watched who saved youLei dark golden eyes staring at clyde, the purple blood sword in his hand like a viper general stabbing clyde's throatAnd Clyde is already crazy.Wield a giant sword to block"Drink!" very obtrusively, Kaiser has thrown a giant sword in his hands."Pang!" lei less than responded, the right arm was actually smashed by this giant sword, the gigantic instilled in the fierce vindictiveness also suddenly broke out, lei felt a sharp pain in the arm, was so surprised, his right hand clutching The Purple Blood Sword has already deviated from Clyde by one meter."Humph"The purple blood sword suddenly bent and wound around Clyde's arm around the great sword in the hands of Clyde, and he immediately cut it!" "The broken right hand of Clyde dropped directly to the ground. The broken finger was still bent, and the Greatsword had fallen aside."And there is a ring on the broken right middle finger, which is the very precious space ring of King Finlay."I took it, took it back, took it backClyde paled in pain, but still shoutedIn this space ring, there are 22 magic crystal cards, that is, 22 gold coins, as well as dozens of rare treasures accumulated by the royal family for thousands of years.Just kill him and you can't discard this space ring.This is the accumulation of the royal family for thousands of years."Oh!" A black shadow flashed over, and directly took the severed hand off and fell to the shoulder of the lei."The boss, the more important Clyde is, the more he cannot give him."Babe stood on the shoulders of the lei, the soul sounded," but the boss, he valued this broken hand, but this cut off is nothing precious, ah, is it this ring? ”
