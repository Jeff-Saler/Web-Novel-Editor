In the eastern sky, the feet of the grey-gown man stepped on top of the black dragon in the air, with a confident smile on his face, watching the middle-aged man and the khaki giants in green.“Hey!” a squealing sound that pierced the air, the middle-aged man's sword in the green shirt pierced the head of the khaki giant, “Pang!” The khaki giant’s skull burst open.And the khaki giants are dyingIt was like a huge stone and the fists were directly on the body of the middle-aged man in the green suit."Hey!" Long-term middle-aged population of green clothes spray bloodThe whole person is paleThe tyrannosaur bursting skull actually reunited again.No damage! "Tillon, you still hand it out. I call the earth guard.Not your enemyStanding in the dark robe on top of the black dragon, he said coldly.Middle-aged man in green clothing looks at cold robe peopleSuddenly he said: "Rudy, I can't get it.You don't want to get"I saw the middle-aged man in green clothes, his green light in his hands suddenly rose, standing on the top of the black dragon has always been a look of indifferent to the gray robe this time immediately shocked up:" Stop! ! ! ""boom! "In a burst of loud noise, the green-green light of the middle-aged man in the green-clad suit suddenly shines brightly like the sun, and with the explosion of a fierce explosion.A moment later it dissipated"Tillon, you—" the man in the gray robe pointed at the middle-aged man in green, but he couldn't speak.Middle-aged man in green clothes is paleLooking at the same dark-looking man in a dark face: "Now it's good.Everyone couldn't get it. Rudy. I'm hurt now. But if you want to kill me, it's not so easy.With a sneer, the middle-aged man in the green suit will be directly transformed into a blue-green light flying toward the northeast.The gray-looking man looked at the green-haired middle-aged man flying toward the end of the sky, but his brow furrowed and he did not chase.The khaki-colored giants who were sitting in their grey robes also gradually dissipated."The Skylark Swordsman 'Tilon'? UnfortunatelyCan't kill him right now"The gray robe people whispered secretly, and then the black dragons at the foot of the earth seemed to know what the people in the grey robe thought, huge black wings.Immediately whistled and flew toward southeastThe two Sacred Masters blinked and disappeared at the end of the worldHowever, Bird Hill Town is full of lost scenes, hundreds of thousands of houses collapsed and painfully groaned.An angry curse, a solemn grievance, and a sad cryJust a short whileThe originally calm morning turned into a disaster dayIn the Baruch family living room, Hogg aloneHogg is sitting at the long table now, his brows are lockedAs the actual controller of Bird Hill Town, he must of course consider the residents of the town.Only when the footsteps were heard, butler ‘Shiri’ walked in from the living room: “Adults"" How's lei? Hogg immediately turned and looked at the pastShiri smiled and said: "The adults are relieved. I have washed my wounds for Master Lin.It's wrapped up again, let him eat fullPut on clean and refreshing clothes to sleep, and when the young lei wakes up, it is estimated that it will be a lot better.Hogg, who assuredly noddedOnly his brow is still locked“Is my adult worried about the residents of Bird Hill?” asked Shiri.Hogg nodded and smiled. “Uncle Shiri, the general population of Toyama Town is not like us.It is generally a level two soldierWomen can't do it anymore, when the big rocks in the air keep fallingIt's hard for them to resist! Shiri noddedThere are only a handful of people who practice ‘vindictive’ in the entire town of Toyama.At that time thousands of thousands of rocks fell in the airUnless you hide in the cellar early or use a shield to resist,The consequence... "Now you can only wait for the results of their statistics."Hogg's heart is very anxiousAfter a long time, a rush of footsteps rang out in the living room<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> Hogg's eyes light up and look upI saw Hillman running into the living roomHillmanHow is the injury and death of Bird Hill? "Hoger inquiredHillman sighed with deep sorrow: "I have already calculated that the entire town has already killed more than 300 people and injured an estimated 1,000 people."The whole town has only a total of more than 5,000 people and nearly one-fifth of casualties."This is still a case of stone houses and other places of protection."So much casualty?" Hogg eagerly got up.The most important thing for a country is foodA small town also needs foodNowadays, the labor force has been reduced so much, and those disabled people still need to feed, so that the township economy is estimated to be even harder."Oh!" Hogg sighedHe wants to reduce taxesHowever, the tax for Bird Hill Township has been very low. Even the maintenance of his family is now a problem.How can he help town residents? And like some other towns, the tax is highMany peasants have to die hard"Horge adultsThe residents of the township are grateful for your kindness. You know everything about what you do. Don't worry too much.Hillman persuaded on the sideHillman is the birthplace of Bird Hill Town.As a Hillman Sixth Warrior, even a king can be selected as an Guard Captain in an aristocrat.However, Hillman was thankful for the Baruch family for the town of Bird Hill, so Hillman retired from the army and became the captain of the declining family of the Baruch family.HillmanYou lead the guard team members to go around the town to seeUncle HeathYou also go to restHogg said directly"Yesgrown upHillmanThe housekeeper Shiri is also in chargeThen Hillman left the living room in turn, leaving Hogg alone in the living room.... lei's bedroomLei head injuryHousekeeper Shiri also let everyone not to bother lei, let lei take a good restWhen the birds outside the town of a messy, lei is very quiet in the bedroomLei himself is immersed in the dream“叮~~~” The slight trembling whisper sounded. I saw a round of flares emerging from the chest of the lei. Then the ring of dragons in the darkness under the halo shook slowly from lei's chest pajamas. Came out and levitated 10 minutes away from the lei chestThe tremors have become more intense, and the halo of the Dragon Ring is also growing.Fortunately, no one came in at LEI's bedroom at the moment.If someone comes in, he will be stunned and LEI himself will still sleep sweetly.Do not know that this has been suspended in the ring of dragons"Oh!" I saw that the halo of the Dragon Ring suddenly shrank suddenly, and then it turned into a misty streamer, and that stream of fanaticism flew out of the Ring of Dragons.Then landed next to the bedDirect to one personThis is a guy wearing a white robeThe hair is white and the old man is embarrassed.The Dragon Ring was also directly and powerless to fall.Landed on the chest of leiLei eyelids move, then slowly openWhen I saw this old man who had never seen beforeNot help but shocked: "You, who are you?" "Little guy, helloMy name is Drincowwater, the Sanctuary of Mt. "The old man said with a smileLei eyes suddenly rounded: "YouAre you a Sanctuary Magister? "The old man nodded confidently"No, grandpa.Did you just say Puang Empire? The Puang Empire that had been destroyed by the country more than 5,000 years ago?
