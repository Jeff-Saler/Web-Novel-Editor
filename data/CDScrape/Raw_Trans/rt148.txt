Hearing a pity that a genius was such a word, Clyde could not help but be overjoyedHe already understands the choice of the Pope Hittings"You retreatHaitings waved and said indifferently"Yes, His Holiness PopeClyde bowed respectfully, and then left the top floor of this bright shrine. There was only one person in the hall on the top floor.Hittings walks to the window and looks down at the city below in the city of Finlay. He keeps silentFor a long time - "Hey!" "Hey!" "Hey!""Come inHaitings said plainlyIt was Gilmer dressed in a red robe that stepped into the hall. Gilmer took a look at Hittings's back. He could feel that Hittings' mood was not good, and he respectfully whispered: "Your Majesty, how are we going to persuade LYN What?” “Persuasion? No?Haitings said indifferentlyGilmer couldn't help but look up and look at Haitings. If you want to use lei as your own, at least you have to persuade lei at the very least.After all, Haynes had seriously injured the lei shortly afterwards.And lei also has a great cry with Clyde"Gilmer, do you know who Lin's mother is?" Haitings turned to Gilmer.Gilmer gave a glimpse and wondered: "If lei's mother doesn't live with her younger brother Lin, is it hard for him to die?"Haitings shook her head and said, "When you first learned the truth about Charlie's mother, you did not find out the facts. Lin's mother was actually the woman we got 12 years ago.""Twelve years ago that woman! Gilmore immediately remembered because the woman had a great influence on the high level of the Temple of Light.""Ah, his mother has been killed by us, then?” Gilmer suddenly realized that the Pope was troubled by his heart.This genius of lei is really attractiveBut in the future, once lei finds out his mother’s messageThe threat to the Holy See may be greater“Gilmer, on the 28th of this month, is the time when the Lord of Light is the most gloriousHaitings said very abruptly"YesGilmer wondered why Hittings said so."Prepare, I am ready to go late that night and pray that the Lord will come downHaitings said indifferently"God pet?" Gilmer shockedBut suddenly he knew Haitings’s ideaAt the bottom of my heart, I also sigh. "The Pope's majesty may be for the lion to cast his love for God.Although lei’s achievements in the future are limited, his talents will not be worse in the future.It's just a pity that he's talented"God's pet, is actually the body of the Lord of Light and the advent of the power of faith."The Lord of LightAs the strongest person of the Lord God, the body, with the power of faith, can completely wash one's soul and make this person absolutely believe in and be loyal to the Lord of light.Unless this person's soul reaches the sanctuary level and condenses into substance, it can resist washing with the power of faith.Otherwise... absolutely no resistance! However, the soul is subject to the washing of the power of the Lord Himself, and it will also affect lei's talent.Afterwards, the achievements must be reduced"Unfortunately, a pityHaitins sighed againHe was just before Clyde.It's a pity that it's for such a reasonHittings is also very reassuring because once it is washed by the power of faithLei even knew his mother's things laterWill continue to be faithful and loyal to the Lord of lightThe power of faith is deep in the soul! Ten days passedThe entire city of Finlay is still a quiet place in the past, but the rich aristocrats in the city of Finlay feel a depressing atmosphere.Such as Clyde's death, this time is very bad temper, there have been several noble ministers touched his moldy, was defamedNext to the Xiangxi Avenue, behind a luxury hotel, a group of people is gathering in a quiet three-story building.Yale, Renault and George have all been gathering here.Since she knew lei's affairs, the three of them are worrying about lei every day. They are very clear about how much lei has caused trouble this time - publicly attacking king clyde and killing more than a thousand elite warriors in the kingdom.Even provoked the pope to end up personally“Yale boss, did your people find the news of the third place?” George asked, Renault also looked at the leiYale shook his headThe three of them face are ugly. They grew up with them when they were young. They ate and slept together at the Ernst Magic School. Although they were not brothers, they were better than their brothers.They could not watch lei and were killed"I have no way. We simply cannot reach the upper classYale was anxious. "You wait a few more days. My father, he is coming soon.""Yale's father - Monroe Dawson! Dawson Chamber of Commerce president, in charge of the horrible Dawson family, the wealth of their own even the two major leagues, the four empire are eyelidsHowever, their commercial network is spread throughout the cities of the Magnolia continent, which can completely affect the economic prosperity and recession of a country.The three major chambers of commerce, the influence of any one chamber of commerce is horribleThe two major confederations and the four major empire are not willing to tear their cheeks from the three major chambers of commerce because once a certain chamber of commerce breaks the cheeks with an empire, it is likely that an empire’s economy will collapse and it will fall back in an instant for decades. Internal may be confused“Yale boss, you two days ago, also said that as long as a few daysIf you wait any longer, I'm afraid..." Renault was anxiousYale is helplessThis time his father was playing in a kingdom not far from the Kingdom of Finlay. He knew that he would immediately send a message to his father.He hoped that his father would immediately rush to the city of Finlay. In his capacity as president of the father’s Dawson Chamber of Commerce, he estimated that Hattins needed to personally receive<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Father came forward and saved lei, but it was much more likely"Master, Master"A lean young man rushed in and ran excitedly."President adults arrived""father! "Yale suddenly stood up in surprise and there was even a glimmer of hope in Renault and George."Bright Temple dedicated to greet VIPs in the living roomStanding two meters tall, the bald fat man with a big belly stepped into the living room with a smile.This bald-headed fat man, with its two-meter height, and that terrible waistlineI'm afraid there are three or four hundred pounds in weightThisIt is the president of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce that Menlo Dawson enters the pope of light - HaitinsHattinsThe height is also two meters, but Haitings is elongatedThese two people, a big fat one, a thin tall, and they are still baldContrast it is really interestingBehind Menlo DawsonTwo middle-aged people, one is a blond man with a pair of indifferent Hawkeyes, the other is a strong red-haired manThe two men are standing solemnly behind Menlo DawsonThere is no doubt that these two are nine strong! Behind Hattins, there are two archbishops in red, one male and one female.Gilmer and Marina respectively"Oh, His Holiness Pope” Monroe Dawson shouted exaggeratedly and then tried hardHowever, Menlo Dawson’s bellyBending is really a very hard thing"Monroe, please sit downHaitings said very kindlyMonroe Dawson is even seatedHittings is also seatedMonroe Dawson was really too big and the average chair wasn’t really goodThanks to the preparations made by the Holy SeeMonroe sat downThen he touched his long and long-haired character with satisfaction, and laughed: "His Majesty the PopeI was playing in Qingshi Lake this time. Whoever wants my son to let me overWell, you know, I’m a father and there’s no way."" Monroe, you are indeed very fond of the little YaleHaitings said with a smileMonroe Dawson reluctantly nodded: "Oh, that little guyBut listening to Yale said to me that he had a very good brother, called lei.Not only stone masters, but also magic geniuses and powerful warriorsI listened and my heart was admired.Just listening to Yale said, this lei was detained in your bright shrine"" There is such a thingHaitings noddedMonroe Dawson smiled and said: "His Majesty, give me a face, let this leiYoung people, who will not be impulsive? Although I also knew he was going to assassinate the Clyde, Kyle could not have died.This is a trivial matter, and it must be thought that Pope will not care too much about it.”Mello Dawson said in an understatementBut Haitings can't answer casuallyThis Monroe Dawson, said letting Haitings give him a faceIf Hittings refuses directly, isn't it not to give face to face Dawson Dawson? Don't watch Luo Daoshen smile, but Hittings is very aware of the amazing strength of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce"MonroeHaitings shook his head. "Not that I don't give you face, but I really don't let him go."Because... lei, also killed the people of the Inquisition, especially the disciple of wusennuo, wusennuo was very angry this time.""Wenson? "Dorothy Dawson browsWu Sennuo, another giant of the Holy See - the referee of the InquisitionIn essence, the Holy See should have two chief figures, one is the bright pope on the Ming surface, and the other is the chief person who kills and executes all pagans—the referee of the Inquisition."It's a bit troublesome"Dorothy Dawson knew it was badThis Haitings may also take care of his identity, but the cold guy of Wushenno is simply a murderous madman.However, Menlo Dawson also guessed“This lei killed the disciples of Wu Sennuo? This is not a Haitingsi chaotic book, and I couldn’t ask Wusennuo.“Mello Dawson was helpless. He also understood that Haitings obviously did not want to let go of lei.Monroe Dawson is indeed very eye-pleasingEspecially know that lei can even become a dragon blood warriorThis lei has great potential, both magical and fighter.Once he got the lei from the Dawson Chamber of Commerce, Lin Lei stepped into the Sanctuary.The influence of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce may exceed the other two chambers of commerce in one stroke"If so, then I'll go firstMonroe Dawson stood up directlyHaitingsi smiled lightly: "I'm really sorry, Monroe, and now the punishment for lei inside the Holy See is not yet established. When the penitentiary within the Holy See is established, I will send someone to tell you."Well, I have stayed in the city of Finlay during this period of time. I still want to see the Magnolia Festival soon. If Yulan's 10,000-year Magnolia Festival is so grand, I'm afraid I can only see it once in a lifetime."“Mello Dawson said with a smileThen, Menlo Dawson, he left with two guards.Haitings indifferently looked at Monroe's departure. Next to Gilmer, he whispered: "Uncle Pope, Monroe's dead fat man is still trying to get lei, and wait until after the twenty-eighth, this Monroe again Any idea is useless“Hettings looked back at Gilmer and smiled, leaving the welcome hall.Now, just wait for the January 28th
