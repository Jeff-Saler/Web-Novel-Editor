In the ninth floor of the Temple of LightLin Lei seems to have been forgotten like the entire person was thrown hereOnly the purple deacon's purple robe deputy director of the daily delivery of food to lei in front of the lei, arm bones have been broken, can only move the body, bow to eatIn the dark and dark cold room, lei spends day aloneIt is raw, it is deadLei do not know, but lei will not give up the hope of lifeThese days, lei has also been thinking about why this revenge failed. This vengeance process is all in lei's plan. Even Clyde has a warcraft lei calculatedHowever, LEI did not think that there was even a sanctuary-level magic defense scroll! Making magic scrolls can be harder than displaying magicTo create a Sanctum-level magic scroll, whether it is consumed by magic or spiritual power, it must be more than directly to perform a sanctuary level magic.Lei does not think that clyde will have a sanctuary defense magic scrollLian Delinckwater also said: “Don't say Clyde, the Archbishop of Red, I’m afraid there will not be a Sancrit Level Defense Scroll."The strength of nine warriors after linlonglongization, plus the power of babeAccording to the truth, Clyde must die.Although lei's revenge plan is slightly anxious, the actual success rate is almost 10%.However, the appearance of destiny protects the lei plan from being destroyed."Who thinks of a king of the kingdom, there is a magic scroll of sanctuaryLei is not reconciledReally do not want to spend late winter, the temperature is very lowIn the city of Finlay, there are few people on the street. A black shadow mouse is standing on a corner of a street corner, watching the shimmering temples in the distance.The shadow mouse just looked at it, motionlessA small shadow rat babe from late at night to dawn, a stay hereHe did not dare to enter the temple of light, because Bebe is very clear that the temple of light is not a strong sacred siteHe must have escaped a World of Warcraft mouse.When it was caught, lei would certainly be more sadIts daybreak"Boss, I will definitely revenge for you” Bebe looked at the last sight of the Temple of Light, stature a move, it disappeared in the streetThis is nearly 20 daysShadow mouse babe has been thinking about revenge for leiBut he foundToday's Clyde is really a scary figure. Not only does the magician arrange a magic array around him, but also makes Caesar live next to him.Shadow Mouse Bebe even has no opportunity to attackHowever, Bebe is very patientHe will wait and wait.Until the day Clyde desolated, he would suddenly appear to directly crush the Clyde bite, revenge for the LEI.Midnight on December 28"Dangdang!" Linley's secret room door opened, two white rituals directly into it, they are not as cold as the referee deacons, they also carried a stretcher, lei very carefully placed on a stretcher, but the two together to lift Lei"What?" lei glanced at two white ritual glancesTwo white rituals thought of the day's killing of leiLei on the bottom of my heart"I'm an adult, lei, the pope is ready to treat you for the injury."One of the women's white rituals said softly"Treatment of injuries?" lei heart of a move"Is that Pope really going to give me a way out?" lei did not say much and remained silentEven though these two white rituals carried him, they continued to move upstairs toward the Temple of Light.One after another... finallyThe two white rituals carried lei and came to the top of the temple of lightAt the moment, the top of Bright Temple is very openIn the most central position, there is a complicated octagonal magical figure. Eight effigies, who are wielded in buns and barefoot in linen cloths, are sitting safely on the eight corners of the magic figure while wearing a bright white ornate gown. The bright Pope Hittings is standing in the central position of the magic figureOn the edge of this top hall, there are three archbishops in red, two deputy referees in honor of the position of the Inquisition, and six special deacons.Each of these people is a nine-level strongThere are so many 9 strong people, so you can imagine the power of the Holy See"Let's go, you guys can goGilmer said in aloud"Yes"The two whites don't dare to take a breath. At present, in this hall, it's not the astonishing stunts, the most mysterious super deacon in the Inquisition, there are three red archbishops and two vice referees.This is all great people.After laying down lei, the two white rituals resigned and respectfully left, and the gate closed again.Lying on a stretcher, lei swept his eyes on this big bloke. It was easy to judge with leilei's eyesight. Everyone in the top floor hall is a very powerful person with amazing strength. I am afraid there is no stronger than that nine. Caesar Weak"What is your going to do under the Pope?" lei's voice was low and hoarseHaitings looked at lei and said lightly: "LEI, although this time you committed a mistake is not small, but after deliberation within our Holy See, decided to give you another chanceAnd now, we are ready to use our magic to restore you to the best possible conditionLei if you know a little about the magic of the light, it will be easy to find the hole in the seatings“Grandpa Delrin, Bright Temple seems to have a big move this timeLei exchanges with the soul of delin kowtor“What's happening outside?” Drinkovt was careful, not even a trace of the power of the soul would not release.Because Hittings is the strongest of the holy lands, the light pope will surely find it once Delingkwater leaves the Panlong Ring.“There are 20 people outside. It is estimated that the weakest are nine strong players. Eight of them are light and the Pope is in a magic chart.Lei saidDe Lin Ke Watert's insights can be much more than lei: "lei, to let you fully recover, just to make a bright line of the sacred strong, to display the light of life, you can completely recoverDo not need such a big momentum at allIn my opinion, they are likely to summon the energy of the Lord God of Light. Otherwise, they do not need to be so powerful."<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Light Lord is more than oneBut the Lord of Light is the most powerful one"Summon the energy of the Lord God?" lei surprised"They deal with meSummon the energy of the Lord God. What are they going to do? ""I am not sure as wellIn the era of Drinkovt, both the Vatican and the Dark Vatican were relatively weak, only two religions in the Pu'ang Empire.At that time, there were few masters of the Holy See, and it was impossible to come up with so many masters like today."His MajestyTime is upGilmer said respectfullyHaitings looked up and looked up and nodded slightly"let's startHaitings said indifferentlyThe eight practisers who sat cross-legged and had their body surface immediately showed a milky glow. The rich and powerful magical powers immediately poured into the magic figure. The entire magical line immediately began to light up, and suddenly appeared in front of Hittings. A golden Bible, Haitings’s body is gradually emitting goldHittings opens a page in the Bible"Lord, you gave us everythingHaitings whispered, but his voice rang like a thunder in the hearts of everyone on the court.At the same time, the golden light on the surface of the Bible is great, and the holy white light in the magical chart is also in full bloom.When two light touches - "Oh -" a straight light shoots directly to the topEntered the spire of the Temple of LightThen broke through the spire, and shot above the boundless dark night sky.The entire city of FinlayYou can clearly see the holy white, golden entangled light that goes into the sky.Bright Temple Top HallHaitings suddenly sees leiLei whole person felt a strong force holding him, making lei the entire person slowly flew upIn the end, Lin Lei flew directly to the center of the magic chart.That's head of Hittings“Lord, He loves the world, and we must believe in the Lord"Hettings looked up, but his face was exudes a holy radiance“The temple of Guangming began to oscillate all over the sky. A milky halo began to appear in the sky above the Temple of Light. The scope of this milky halo was too great. Many people in the city of Finlay had noticed it."Betrayed the Lord, the Lord will deprive him of His giving, and believe in the Lord, and the Lord will bestow his favor.Haitings read a page in the Bible"Boom!" The turbulence in heaven and earth, above the bright temple, was originally boundless night, but now that milky halo is extremely brightIn the center of the milky halo, space cracked a crack and a white light shot from the air."Yeah!" The white light, with the pressure of all people's heartbeat, fell directly across the top of the Temple of Light and eventually landed on the body of LEI suspended above the magic figure.Bright Temple Top HallHaitings, the eight sitters, the three red cardinals, the two deputy referees, and the six super deacons all looked up at lei, and the coercion contained in the white light was that Haitings gave birth to it. Respect, beliefAlthough it is only a power of faith, it is derived from the Lord of Light itself.White light completely into the lei body, lei immediately surface of the whole body surface shows a faint white light, lei's body at the same time repaired at an alarming rateAlmost blindingly, LEI's broken bones and wounds were completely repaired.Lei physical condition is unprecedented"Ah, lei's soul groaning, when the white light into the lei body, repair lei injury is only a subsidiary role, the first goal of this white light is the soul of leiThis white light is obviously going to be integrated into the soul of lei.Once the power of faith is fused with the soul of lei, lei will no longer be able to escape from the shackles of the Lord of Light and will always be loyal to him.At this time - a force to the ultimate power, directly from the ring of dragons on the fingers of lei spread out, through lei's body directly into the minds of leiThe power of that horror directly wrapped up the power of this belief and disappeared without a trace.Then, this terrorist force once again passed through the body of lei and returned to the Ring of Dragons."Grandpa Delin, how is it?" lei eagerly"I don't know. It was the power of the Dragon Ring itself. The power was too scary, too, too horrible."Drinking Watert nervously only said too horrible.Derlin Kewater had a dragon ring more than 5,000 years ago.However, Drincowwater did not know that the inside of the Panlong Ring actually contained such a horror to the ultimate energy.Drincowout is very certain that if this energy is to attack people, it is the top ten strongest sanctuary and it will turn into fly ash in a flash."This energy doesn't know what's going on. As a master of the Dragon Ring, I can't sense it, let alone use it.Lei heart also understand that this energy is not so easy to use, in the past, when Delin Ke Water was alive, but wearing a panlong ring for nearly a thousand years, did not use that energyAnd this time - the people in the top hall of the Great Temple of Light were shocked. Pope Hittings, there were eight ascetics, three red archbishops, two deputy referees, and six deacons could not believe this. SceneIn their view, there was no scent of god pets on lei, and there was no bright mark on his forehead."How could it fail?" Haitings stared at the lei
