Whether the mother is dead or dead... "It's easy to kill Padson."But it was difficult to kill Padson so that nobody else could detect it.After all, in addition to killing Paderson, lei still needs to continue to query the mother's news.Drinkovt nodded slightly: "You make your own decisionsI just hope that you don’t have a feverAfter all, your current strength is still too weak compared to the real strong ones. It is Padson. All the horses are also stronger than you.Lei nodded slightlyPadson is the younger brother of Clyde.

No, notLei lien saidDelia could not help but smile proudly, and then delia sighed and said: "Lin Lei, so late today, I really want to tell you something"" Say it"LEI can not help but suspect delia to say whatDelia reluctantly said: "You know, lei, now is the magnolia calendar 9999 years, there are eight months is the magnolia calendar 10000 yearsThe first day of the year is the Magnolia Festival, the largest festival in the entire Magnolia continent. The importance of Magnolia Festival in the 10,000-year Magnolia calendar is also conceivable.Lei noddedOnly lei did not understand why delia said this“Although the entire Magnolia continent has attached great importance to the 'Magnolia Festival', our Magnolia Empire is the most important one.Delia continuedLei also understand that, after all, the first year of Yulan calendar, it is the year that the Yulan Empire unified the entire Magnolia continent.The Magnolia Festival, a 10,000-year Magnolia calendar, is indeed an extremely important day for the Magnolia Empire."My family also gave orders. This time, I must rush back to my family during the Magnolia Festival.On this Magnolia Festival, I will celebrate the whole country with the Magnolia Empire. Naturally, I can not be an exception as my brother-in-law of the Lions family."Delia looked at lei." lei, the magnolia empire is too far away from the sacred alliance. This time, I am afraid that it will take more than a year for nearly two years, and tomorrow I will immediately return to my motherland."Teng Linlei knew what Delia meant.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> is also more than a year later, delia and I may not be able to meetDelia looked at lei and bit her lip before she said: "LeiCan I embrace you before leaving? ""embrace? Lei stunned, looked at deliaDelia's own heart, lei is very clearJust because the two people were in contact with each other too much, they knew from the first grade of Ernst Magic School.In lei's heart, delia can be used as a confidanteEspecially after Alice’s incident happened, lei’s heart could be said to have been frozenLooked at Delia's eyes, lei noddedDelia face a smile, immediately lining her hands around the neck of the lei, leaning forward with the body lean tightly with leiDelia's face is also lightly touching lei's faceLei even felt the breath of each otherI also smell the charming scent of Delia.In particular, the two people touched each other and the temperature of each other's skin was transmitted... This made lei feel a special strange feeling."Leithank youDelia whispered in lei's earLei did not say anythingDelia slowly straightened up, but her eyes still stared at the eyes of leiCan be uprightDelia has settledShe stayed with her when she was just five centimeters away from each other's eyes.Abruptly, Delia leaned overDelia that lips just posted in the lei's lips, lei suddenly stunnedDelia did not respond to lei at all and quickly got upLooked at lei, they quickly ran out of lei's bedroom"Boss, you were kissed!" Babe from the side of the quilt emerged, staring at the lei"You give me sleepLei soul attack soundedBabe reluctantly shrank back to bedAnd lei watched Delia's bedroom doorBut the faintness of the nose can also smell the body of Delia. The skin on her face still seems to remember the slight warmth of Delia's face.Touched his lipsLei felt that there was a warmth in his heart, just like the kind of warmth that had been chatting with Alice in the middle of the night on two balconies."Delia..." She threw her head off and lei dismissed it."Lei"Drincovott looked at LEI with great interest“When I was young, I only went to the Ernst Magic School. When I first saw the little girl Delia, I said, she is a beautiful woman.I let your kid chase her. Now, regret it? Lei brow wrinkled, took a look at delin cowort"Well, I don't say"Drinkovt's white beard and Alice, the whole person turned into a white streamer and entered the ring of dragons.Lei no longer think about it, sat cross-legged on the bed, began to exercise spiritual power meditationThe next morning, Delia led the Ryan family and left the town of Wushan. LEI did not see him. He was still living in the living room.In an instant, lei xiaoxiao has passed seven daysIn addition to several good brothers of Yale and other lei, Wushan Town also has only two big names left—Gilmer and Lampson.As the Archbishop of Red, Gilmer and Lampson did not have anything in common. After all, some trivial matters were solved by hand.Their days are naturally relaxing, and these days they often visit around Wushan Town, and sometimes they also enter the Osan Mountains.In the morning, residents of Wushan Town are watching on both sides of the street.The people of the Holy See and the Dawson Chamber of Commerce began to advance."Yale boss, second child, fourth child, I have something to talk to Gilmer adults.Lei said with her own good brother, then directly left the carriage of Dawson Chamber of Commerce, and then entered the carriage of the red cardinal Gilmer adults.Lampson also entered the room. The two red cardinal adults and lei will ride in a carriage.But this carriage is for the red cardinal archbishop, with a great internal space. The three people have enough space to lie down to sleep."LEI, have you decided?" Gilmer laughed at leiAt the beginning, lei and Gilmer said that if it is necessary to consult with his father about becoming a member of the Holy See, now Hogg is dead.Lei naturally no one can discuss, and now he should also tell the other answer"Gilmer, Lord Lampson, I'm still young now. I think... for the time being, let me help Clyde get down and you don't have to enter the church.When the Holy See needs me, it can be called at any timeLei saidGilmer and Lampson both laughedClyde? Clyde is the king of the kingdom of Finlay, and the kingdom of Finlay is the city of the city of Finlay which is also the sanctuary of the Holy See.And the Kingdom of Finlay must listen to the orders of the Holy SeeLei assists Clyde, it is equivalent to loyalty to the Holy See"well"Lampson first laughed." lei, this is a very wise decision"Either Lampson or Gilmer do not know. The reason why lei chose this way is that the most important thing is to inquire about his mother."He only goes into the affairs of the Kingdom of Finlay, and will have more opportunities to deal with the Duke of Padersen in the future.Gilmer also laughed and said: "You are now part of our bright church.By the way, you haven’t had magic spells in the land system, wind system seven, eight, nine, and taboos.""YesLei nodded. "I just guessed the magic spell of flying from the principle of magic."Gilmer said, "The magic of flying spells isn't too difficult, but you can reason from floats and it's pretty good."Lei, you can rest assured that when I return to the Holy See, I will quickly send someone to send you various spells of magic spells in the Department of the Earth's Department of the 7th and 7th levels.”
