"Dragon Blood Warrior?" lei felt his head jerkedIn the eyes of leiHis family is also an ancient, declining family. How could it be linked to the legendary four ultimate fighters? “You don’t believe it?” Hogg’s face had a pride"LEI, you can go and look closely at those linguistic places.You are now literate, and every spiritual place is engraved with the story of this ancestor.The ancestors represented on the top three linguistic positions are all Dragon Blood Warriors! "Hogella lei's hand:" follow meHogg with leiGoing to the rear of the numerous spiritual places, Hogg picked up lei: “You look closely at the handwriting behindLei eyes wide-eyed - the top of the spiritual position is deeply carvedIt is very clear that the ancient writings with a long history of five thousand years contain one earth-shattering story! "Baruch, Magnolia's First Dragon Blood Warrior, Magnolia Calendar, 4560Baruch meets Frost Dragon and Black Dragon under the city of Linnan CityUltimately kill the Frost Dragon and the Black Dragon, making the world famousThe Magnolia Calendar In 4579, Baruch met the Hydra King on the mainland coastline of the North Sea.The tsunami continued on the day and the city crackedAfter a fierce battle one day and one night, Baruch finally killed the Hydra Emperor... and finally established the Baruch family. Baruch was the first generation patriarch! "Ryan BaruchMagnolia Mainland Second Dragon Blood WarriorMagnolia Calendar In 4690, defeated in the Warcraft Mountains and received a Sanyo Gold DragonBecome a Golden Dragon Paladin! Magnolia Calendar 4697..." "Hazede Baruch, the third Dragon Blood Warrior in Magnolia Mainland, was born in 5360. The first battle was in the Sanctuary of the Sunset Mountains.Defeated the bloody lions and defeated them to make them run away. The world is famous..."...a great nameA shocking deed, leaching the body of lei"My family, turned out to be the Dragon Blood Warrior family?" lei excited for a long timeNext to Hogg, he said lowly, "We have three consecutive generations of the Baruch family.Once you become a Dragon Blood Warrior, life will be extremely longRyan Baruch, the second generation chief, waits until he is more than seven hundred years old to marry his wife and children."" Behind it? Lei doubted, "fatherWhy are there no dragon blood warriors in our family now? "Hogg nodded:" To become a dragon blood warriorMainly to see the blood concentration of blood dragon blood in the body, the higher the concentration, the betterWith the passage of children from generation to generationLater, the children of the Baruch family, the body blood concentration of dragon blood warriors will become increasingly thin, but ... is not absolute, because with the passing down from generation to generation, sometimes there will be suddenly a child of Dragon Blood Warrior blood High concentration"After Hazeld Baruch, about a millennium, we have the fourth Dragon Blood Warrior in the Baruch family."Then about another fifteen hundred yearsAfter dozens of generationsThe fifth Dragon Blood Warrior appeared in our familyHowever, after more than a thousand years until now, there is not a Dragon Blood Warrior.Hogg sighed and shook his head: "The fifth Dragon Blood WarriorJust existed on the mainland of Magnolia for more than two hundred yearsThen it disappeared. For more than a thousand years, our Baruch family has completely declined."A thousand years of time, then a glorious family, may also decline."However, our family still has hopeMaybe generations of childrenThe blood concentration of the Dragon Blood Warrior in the body reaches the condition of being a Dragon Blood Warrior, and as long as it reaches that condition, it can become a true Dragon Blood Warrior for decades, and our Baruch family can be restored to the original Dragon Blood Warrior family again. 'Glory! "Hogg's eyes shine," lei, you are six and a half years old, according to the rules, reaching six years oldThe blood concentration of Dragon Blood Warriors detected is more accurateNowadaysI will test it for you"LEI heart startled:" Detect Dragon Blood Warrior blood concentration? Detect me? Lei understands what his father didThis testWill detect if he owns the conditions for becoming a Dragon Blood Warrior"LEI, you wait for a while, I'll go for the Dragon Blood Needle."Hogg said with a slight excitement, Hogg then walked towards the secret room behind the ancestral hall."Dragon Warrior? Will I become a Dragon Blood Warrior?"Standing in the ground lei panickinglyHave expectationsThere is also a hint of fear, fearing that the blood concentration of Dragon Blood Warriors in their own bodies does not meet the conditions."If he fails, his father will probably be disappointed.Lei couldn't help but thinkSince childhood, I have been with my father and my brother.Lei does not want his father disappointedOnly the blood concentration of the Dragon Blood Warrior in the body is not what he can determine.Just for a moment, Hogg held a long, transparent pin that was nearly twenty centimeters long.Come out of the secret room behind the ancestral hall"Dragon blood needle?" lei looked at his father's long needle, naturally guessing the name"All rightLei, the needle tip just punctured the skin, no pain, his hands out" Hogg said with a smile, lei nodded, then took a deep breath and stretched out his right hand out, that shivering right hand also reflects the moment lei really nervous<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> is not just lei, actually Hogg himself is also very nervous"Hold it a littleThe transparent dragon blood needle in Hogg's handsLightly stabbed in the right index finger of lei, easily punctured the skin, lei only felt a pain in pain, that dragon blood needle also changed from transparent to redHogg trembled and put the dragon blood needle in front of him and observed it carefully.Lei up headEyes stare at his father's heart and said: "I have enough blood in the blood of the Dragon Blood Warrior in my body? Why did he look at the Dragon Blood Needles for so long?" Good premonition"Hey..." A sighHogg puts the dragon blood needle asideHearing his father's sighs, she felt nervous for a long time and lei knew that the blood of Dragon Blood Warriors in his body certainly did not meet the conditions.The tears rush out"lei, how do you cryDon't cry, heyDon't cryHogg immediately picked up leiLooked at crying lei, Hogg is also a distressedAfter all, lei is only six and a half years old now.Still a child"No cry, no, don't cryLei sobbed two times, forcibly tears"Father, I'm sorry, I let you downHogg heard lei say soOnly feel warm in my heartCan not help lei tightly in his arms: "leiDo not be sadIn fact, my father did not hold much hope. For more than a thousand years, none of the tens of generations had become a dragon warrior.You can't reachNothing, father does not blame you"Feel the warmth of my father's chestLei heart gradually relaxedAt this time, Walton, who was only two and a half years old, had fallen asleep in the arms of the housekeeper, Shiri."LEI, now that the Baruch family is only me, and you and your brother, I didn't aim much in my life.Become a Dragon Blood Warrior, I dared not expect itHogger laughedBecome a Dragon Blood WarriorIs it easy? Lei also looked up at his fatherLei rarely sees his father talking to himselfThe usual father is so strong and so severeHogg looked at the row of souls, and said with a hint of faint grief: "My true goal is actually to get back the treasure of our Baruch family."What is the inheritance treasure? How can I not hear it?" Lei curiously askedHogg said proudly: "Our family heritage treasure - swords ‘killing” is the first generation of our Baruch family patriarch, the first of the Magnolia mainland Dragon Warrior Baruch land weapons唉...children are not filialMore than 600 years agoBecause the family declinesThe generation of patriarchs sold their treasures in family heritage for their own luxury."When it comes to this, Hogg's body trembles angrily."Sell the treasure of inheritance?" LEI also had some anger in the bottom of my heart, even if he was only six and a half years old.But after reading a lot of books, I also understandIt is difficult to not sell the inheritance treasureNot to mention what his father said, that generation of patriarchs just for their own enjoyment of luxuryHogg shook his head and said helplessly: "Each generation after the patriarch, want to fight the sword to kill" to get it back, but this goal, our children have worked hard for six hundred years and did not succeed, after all, that the knife was 'killing' is If you sell 180,000 gold coins, and 180,000 gold coins, don't say we won't be able to get it out. Even if we get it out, others won't sell it to us."As an ancient dragon blood warrior familyHowever, the inheritance of the family has been sold.This is shame! The old Dragon Blood Warrior family shame! Every generation of people wanted to get the sword to kill, but they did not succeed for six hundred years.Hogg is a family of contemporary chiefsOf course, the same is expected, but the entire family is now very poor economic conditions, 180,000 gold coins? Is to sell the ancestral homesI am afraid that I cannot collect such a large sum of wealth.The treasure of inheritanceThis shame often makes Hogg feel sadI feel ashamed in my heartUnable to face the ancestorsLei saw his father's expressionThe voice said: “Father, rest assured that one day I will bring back the treasures of our family heritage.""you? Hogg laughed and caressed the head of leiIn Hogg's mind, it was an undercover: "LindHow do you know this sentence... I also told your grandfather that year."The efforts of so many generations of disciples in the 600 years have not been successful.What is so easy to do? After all, people who can collect swords and slayCertainly not the average personPeople will sell? Is to sellIs the price still declining and the Baruch family can afford it? "Father does not believe me?" lei heads backLooking at his father doubts"BelieveBelieveHogg laughedFather and son cuddling with each otherThe legacy of the ancient Dragon Blood Warrior family continues to this day, leaving only the three members, an ancient family that has been deteriorating for more than a thousand years.When will it be possible to reproduce the glory of the year? And now lying in his father's arms to the lei, the fist is tight grip!
