In the Drake Hotel's dedicated reception room, two Knights of the Seventh-level Temple face each other on either side of the front door of the reception room, while four people such as Lin Lei entered the door from the inside.Feet stepped on the smooth, mirror-like marble floor, giving a crisp and powerful footstepWhen the four lei and yalu stepped in, the seven people sitting in the reception room turned to look at it."The Archbishop of Red, three priests and three knights"lei identify the identity of the seven people, and lei feel that these seven people are very powerfulAccording to some of the information that lei knows, in the Holy See, the red cardinal is second only to the emperor. To become a red cardinal, not only does the archbishop need to have enough reputation, but at the same time it can reach at least 9 levels of power."Nine great magic guide?" lei could not help but carefully observed the red cardinalThe archbishop in front of him is a middle-aged man with a brown curly hairThe nose is tall and the mouth is always with a smile, the whole person seems to be easy to get close"Hello, leiThere is a little Yale"The red cardinal smiled and got up." I will briefly introduce to you, these three white rituals are my deputies, and these three temples are actually the heads of our glory Knights, Marcus and His two deputy heads, as for me ... you can call me 'Gilmer'"The Archbishop of Red Gilmer"Lei also heard that there are eight ace knights in the sacred league, including the glory knight group. Each of the eight ace knights is extremely powerful and has amazing attacking power."Gilmer adults, Marcus adultsThere are adultsDon't know what you guys have? ” LEI humbly said, at the same time LEI also paid a little attention to MarcusMarcus was a very strong bald warrior. The whole person sat there and felt it was a rock and it was hard to shake.Among the seven people from the Holy See are Gilmer and Marcus, who have the highest status. Marcus, as head of one of the eight ace knights, may not be weaker than Gilmer in strength, and his status is almost the same.Marcus opened his mouth, and the heavy, low voice sounded: "I listened to Gilmer and said that our sacred alliance had a talented genius.Seventeen-year-old seven-level double magicianI've always been curious what this genius looks like, today I see it, haha, I like it very much."In the eyes of Marcus, at a glance, lei is also a soldier."Boy, how much did your warrior rank?" asked Marcus.Gilmer sat there like a good old man, not displeased by Marcus's rushLei humble: "This year has just reached the sixth level warrior""Oh"Marcus had a bright eye." Seventeen-year-old Sixth-grade Warrior has been considered extremely difficult.I Marcus rarely obey people, but I have to admit that you are indeed a geniusIt is not only the practice of magic to this point, but also a good warrior.Lei smiled humblyThe deputy heads of the two knights next to Marcus also appeared very surprised.Gilmer chuckled: "Okay, Marcus.Lei he is a six-level warrior is very good, but the seventeen-year-old six soldiers, casually a warrior college can find one or twoHis most precious thing is magic talent."The difficulty of warrior cultivation is already a little lower than that of a magician.Those who tried to exercise and fight hard since childhoodIf you have a good family background, you will cultivate your temperamentIt wouldn't be too hard to become a sixth-grade soldier at seventeen"LEI, as a member of our sacred alliance, you can have such amazing results.I am proud of you as a cardinal of the templeI want to ask you, are you interested in joining our sacred alliance? I think, with your talentAs long as you join, I can now guarantee that you will become a white ritual for our temple and that it will not be a problem to become a Cardinal in the future.Gilmer throws the pie directlyThe second largest super talent in history, this genius has become the sanctuary and the Magister should be 90% sure.The only one-tenth, it may be because of what happened, which made him unwilling to cultivate himself.The future sanctuaryEven if it does not workAt the very least, it is also a nine-level wizard.Such talentOf course we must absorb it"Gilmer, this news is for meReally too sudden"LEI Lei's face shows a hint of humble and shy smile." I was just 17 years old this year. For those who haven't thought too much, high positions, big rights also mean major responsibility. I don't have the courage to bear it yet." That responsibilityI think ... can we have another few years? Lei resignedGilmer could not help but frownThe second Yulilan history is super genius, and the figure is 90% strong.Even if you can't use it, you can't make it available to the enemy."LEI, I know you are very young. However, you are a member of our sacred alliance. You are also a genius. As a genius, you should adapt to the burden caused by your dazzling light, not to retreat."Gilmer said through good will"Even more than that, you can be the sacred ritual of my majesty. I can also assure you what you want to do. As long as you do not violate the interests of the temple, I will not interfere in your freedom.Can you say that's okay? "And, you can also join any kingdom under the sacred alliance. We can even give you the title of the Duke.""Gilmer's attitude has to be very sincereLei sinks upThe three white rituals beside Gilmer's body were frowned and Gilmer himself was still smiling and looking at lei with great expectation.It's hard to refuse the opponent just by watching this gaze.Next to Lin Lai, Yale, Renault, and George were all silent. Yale did not dare to open the door at this time.What kind of person is Archbishop Red? <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>One of the few people at the top of the Pyramid of the Holy LeagueThe power is greater than the king of a country. His father cannot match it.What is the qualification of a young master in a chamber of commerce? Lei kept thinking about it, and drincowor had reminded lei long before entering the meeting room.The mutual wrestling of the four great empires and the two major leagues is definitely very brutal.‘Not for my own use or for the enemy’s use’. This is a more general view"Yoshikuni AdultLei finally opened upGilmer's eyes lit up and smiled at lei: "have you decided?" lei nodded: "Gilmer adults, I lived in the Kingdom of Finlay since childhood, and naturally I am also a member of the Holy Alliance. I can assure youAs long as the Holy Alliance does not give up on me, I absolutely do not betray the Holy Alliance.No matter which other party, I definitely will not join each other""what do you mean? Gilmer wondered at leiLin Lei continued: "I mean, I'm not in a hurry to make a decision. Please let me discuss it with my father and tell you my choice."What I can guarantee is... Absolutely not joining other four empire and dark alliancesGilmer smiled and nodded. "Yes, you must discuss this important matter with your father."OK, I'll wait for your reply"—Speaking of Gilmer's standing up, the three white rituals next to him and Marcus's three also stood up: "Since it's setThen I will not bother. The sincerity of our bright temple is good and there is enough patience.I just hope that you don’t let me wait ten or twenty years.Haha..." Gilmer laughed as he said.Lei four also stood up and watched Gilmer and others leaveWhen the people of the Holy See left, the hearts of the four brothers of the lei were determined"Whuh, just now I was very nervous and I couldn't breathe.Reynolds said with a breathGeorge also nodded: "The Red Archbishop is very kind with us, but I always feel uneasyYale said with a smile: "That is of course. After all, people are archbishops in red and one of the people in the entire sacred league is in charge of power."HeyThe youngest, what do you think of it? The Holy See is not so good for the other person. After all, we are in the area of ​​the Holy Alliance.Controlled by othersUrgentLei smiled, "you see other people's strength, but also to see their own advantagesAlthough I am not as good as the other party, as long as I do not take refuge in the other five parties, the bright Catholic Church will not move me.Anyway, I said to discuss with my fatherAs long as I don’t meet my father for the time beingIsn't it possible to drag more than one moment? "Lesson said to Yale:" Yale, I've asked you one thing""SayYale looked at leiLei sighed: "It's also a bit ugly to sayOur Baruch family has a family heritage treasure. It is a personal weapon of the first generation of our family's patriarch. It is a sword with a name of ‘Tu Tu’.Today, this tactical knife, ‘mother’, should be in the hands of a great noble in the kingdom of Finlay. I hope you can help me find out."" Family heritage treasures? Of course, this must be found, the youngest, do you want me to help you directly get back? Yale directly saidLei smiled: "yale boss, you can help me to investigate is enough, and I do not lack much gold now” Lin Lei is not like to owe people******* the morning after two daysLei living room floor is covered with a layer of yellow light, this layer of yellow light coverage is not large, probably only about three meters radiusAs long as you step into this area, you will feel an astonishing gravityDepartment of magic - gravity surgery! After reaching the power of seven magicians, lei now has a much greater effect than gravity in the past. Ground gravity is four times normal.Under four times of gravity, not only the body, but also the internal blood and meridians must withstand four times the gravity.Lin Lei himself did not use the magical power of the land to offset this gravitational force. Instead, he used the body to withstand this amazing gravity. At the moment, his whole body was upside down, leaning on the two fingers of the right hand and two fingers, constantly exercising his fingers and following Arm force"... 725, 226"" Tick, tick! "Sweat beads slipped from the corner of lei and dripped onto the ground."The door of the room suddenly opened, and Yaluhing rushed in and rushed inside: "Oh, youngster, you asked me to check the ground about the hacking of the sword."Saying, Yale accidentally stepped into the gravity zone.“YaleLei bravely supported her. The whole person rushed up and pulled Yale directly out of the gravity zone."Call, call"Yale, breathing heavily, looked at lei with astonishment." "The youngest, are you arranging gravity in your room?" I have all recruitedIt felt so uncomfortable just now that the heart seemed to stop suddenly."Fortunately, the time is short, otherwise it will indeed be a problem with Yale's physical fitness.""Yes, Yale boss, you are not saying the sword 'slaughter' it?" LEI thought but in this family ancestral treasure, the greatest hope of his father's life is to let this piece has been circulating since 5,000 years ago The treasures came down to the familyYale nodded slightly: "Oh, I just received the news. The knife of your family's knife, 'the slaughter', was in the hands of a big family in the city of Finlay. The family called and called..." Yale could not help but frown. He couldn't remember the family name at once“Oh, youngest, Yale boss, the chief curator of Maia came in person."Renault's voice rings from outside the door
