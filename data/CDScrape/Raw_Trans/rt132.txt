If I had long gone out, she would go out. It would be nice if she did not slap her."Bebe said with dissatisfactionLei watched babe one: "bebe, people are not warcraft"Derrinkovite flew out of the ring of dragons at this time, and he looked very glad to see lei:" lei, you are performing very wellI still have a little worry. Will you drive her off childishly?""childish? Lei leiAccording to Drinkovt, that kind of behavior is indeed childish."Is it right, a woman, when can't I find it?" Drincowott smiled.Lin Lei was speechless, and he was very unsympathetic to this view of Grandpa Delin.Drinkovt’s point of view is similar to his good brothers Yale and Renault."Well, don't say it, I will continue to practiceLei immediately rose and walked to the spring water parkFor leiAlice asks him to be an episode in his lifeCan not fundamentally affect his feelings, and now the most important thing in the hearts of lei is ... ... revenge for their parentsHis Majesty he worked hard in the study for the state, also asked the lei adults to go to the study with the villainThe court waiter said respectfullyLei noddedLei stood on the shoulders of babe, so walked behind the court waiter to the studyAfter a whileLei finally came to the study office"His MajestyLei adults to!

The Debuss family was suspected of smuggling. Didn't you send Bernard and his son Cardin? "" It is such a thing"Clyde's eyebrows are lifted and they look at Lin Lei." How, do you want to tell their family? "On these days, there are many nobles who have spoken to the Debuss family. The reason why so many nobles help, the debus family's money has worked."If you really want to save their family, I can give you this faceClyde said boldlyWhat Clyde really has to do is destroy the forces established by his younger brother Padson. As for the Debus family, it is just a matter of solving it.He completely put the Derbus family a horse, and earned a human feeling leiAfter all, even if he put the Debuss family, he could also kill a knife in the Debus family."Do notLei shook his head. "I'm not talking about their family."""what? Clyde doubted to see leiLei casually said: "when Clyde is down, the debus family is smuggled, all this naturally business""Oh? Clyde looked puzzled at Lin Lei. "The lei is coming today, it is..." lei smiled and said, "I was wondering if the Debus family was involved in smuggling, and when you left, you seized the patriarch Bernard. As for his son, he won't have to catch it.What's the use of grabbing an heir after all? You caught the first heir. They also have a second heir. As long as their families are not, naturally someone can replace"LEI, do you mean?" Clyde looked to leiLei looked at Clyde: "Your Majesty, please also put the card blue"" Oh, let go of Ka Lan, I heard Kalan with you? "Clyde is very careful about the lei, naturally knows the relationship between lei, kalan and alice.Lei but helpless smile: "Your Majesty, it was a long time ago things"Clyde reminded:" lei, I remind you, according to my search for ka na blue heart, but very narrow, but will remember""I knowLei nodded slightlyIn contact with Kalan several times, lei felt that Kalan was hostile to herself.And...

Clyde continued."His ClydeYou said, his short-sighted little person, I also need to care about him? Lei laughed at clyde, clyde could not help, and then laughed"CorrectNaka Lan used to be old with youI don’t want to make a friendship now, but I’m hostile to youInstead, his father repeatedly wanted to make youCompared with his father, Kalan was really short-sightedClyde also said with a laughClyde patted shoulders of lei: "I'm sure, I will take care of Melody must be business, we must find out the factsAbsolutely not the Debuss familyIf the Kedebus family is suspected of smuggling, I will not let it escape punishment."" Yes, public affairsLei noddedSitting back to the carriage, babe is lying on the lei of the lei"Wow, boss, you're so sinister, that Debus family is absolutely smuggling, and when the family is finishedEven if Karan went out now, will it be miserable in the future? Bebe excitedly saidBebe has long wanted to destroy the card blueLei shook his head and smiled: "It is still hard to say whether the Debus family is really finished.For example, they can send most of the family’s money directly to Clyde.Clyde may put them on a pathCan be said anywayThey fell to Clyde's hands and they delaminated when they died.Lei is very clear about the darkness of the nobilityIt is a public office, just a archway."Compared to Clyde, the Debus family is too muchLei shook his headA small card blue, lei never looked in the eyesNaka Lan and lei are not a layer of peopleLei to deal with is Clyde! "Adults, come"The groom who pays respectfullyLei opened the door and went down, babe jumped to lei on the shouldersJust when lei was about to enter the mansion, an escort next to the guard said respectfully: “Adult, just a guest came, he is in the living room""Guest, in the living room? Lei puzzledThe nobles often saw lei, but those nobles who did not get lei's consent were all waiting outside the gate.Only people of high status, such as the Duke of Bernard, such as Clyde, such as Gilmer, will enter the living room directly.Do not have to wait outside"Who is he?" lei could not help asking"I don't know, but he is holding a red cardinal token"The Guard respectfully said that this escort came from the Holy See, and was very familiar with the Tomb of the Red ArchbishopThe Archbishop of Red Card has a token, and there is only one cardinal for each red cardinal.Of course, some extremely powerful practitioners may also haveThis token, on behalf of a status, represents the person holding the token and is not inferior to the Red Archbishop."token?" lei surprisedImmediately without hesitation, lei immediately walked towards the living room. When lei crossed the corridor and saw the figure in the living room, he was surprisedAt the moment, in the living room, it is a middle-aged man dressed in a loose robe and long black hair. He looks only 30 or 40 years old, giving him a feeling of laziness.When lei looked at this middle-aged man, the middle-aged man seemed to be aware of it and immediately saw it. His eyes revealed the color of surprise: "Master lei, are you here?" "major lei?" lei wondered, But quickly entered the living room"You are, oh, I think of it, you are the one who once offered 10 million gold coins.Lei remembered when the auction was awake stone carving, is the middle-aged quoteThe middle-aged man nodded happily. "I didn't think that Master LEI still remembered me. It really made me excited.By the way, I'll introduce myself first. My name is... Greece! "" Greek? Lei never heard of this name"Xishe?!!" Drinkovt's voice suddenly sounded in lei's mind. "I didn't expect him to be a minor metamorphosis. He stayed in the material plane of Magnolia mainland.Lei leiGrandpa Delin knows this Greek? What is the age of Grandpa Delrin? If he knows, how old is this Greek capital? "LEI, this Greek is a very abnormal guyPractice is very fast, killing people is not blinkingWhen I was alive, Sisse entered the sanctuaryAlthough it was only the beginning of the sanctuary, it can now be over five thousand years. With his cultivation speed, the strength may be even more striking.Lei's heart twitchesIn front of this, the middle-aged man, who appears to be only 30 or 40 years old, was already a strong sanctuary when he was living in Deling Kettle.Derlin Kewalt lived for more than a thousand years but died, but this Greek, careful calculation, at least 6,000 years or soSix thousand-year-old old pervert!
