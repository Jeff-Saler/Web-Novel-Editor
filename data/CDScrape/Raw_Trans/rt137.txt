Lei saw two maids at the door of the living room and ran into a cold cry: “go out, without my orders, do not allow a person to come in"" Yes, adultsThe two maids in the doorway of the living room gave a quiver and quickly and respectfully left quickly."Master lei, kinda carefulShise said with a smileLei heart helplessBe careful? Can you be careless? This is used to kill Clyde."This is Greek, it is estimated that I will have to kill Clyde."LEI understands this in the bottom of my heart. At first, he told Xisse whether he could kill one of the six kingdoms of the sacred confederate and later said that he must deal with nine strong players."As long as Sisse is not a fool, think a little, you will think of the king of nine strongThe Holy Alliance has only one person, Clyde."Hisse old monster, will not try to please Clyde for meLei heart is still very reassuringWhat kind of character? Will also use this kind of character to play with him? "LEI, you have to be carefulThe person you are dealing with, the Holy See is very important"Xixe murmured next to lei." And he guards a lot. You have to poison him, but it's very difficult.Lei looked at Greek eyes: "thank you Mr."To poison Clyde? If LEI lives in danger, it's absolutely 100% sure."Just invite Clyde to your houseThen send him a drink on his own housePoisoning in the wine is absolutely assuredHowever, it will also reveal their identity.To find an opportunity to kill Clyde and let others not noticeThis opportunity is very rare"I'm not always lucky. That's like Clyde and Padson.Come alone and see meLei heart bottom road, when the original paddle quietly met him, it really makes lei overjoyed, the kind of opportunity can never be metLei thought, opened the envelopeThere is a piece of paper in the envelope. The paper is densely packed with lots of handwriting."Pharmaceutical name: Hemolytic poison material: yellow pod, white ginseng, turmeric, misty grassClouds, bitter skin, barley, blue heart grassEffect: Hemolyzed toxic powder into the wine, colorless and tasteless, there is no way to find outOnce in the belly, it will be absorbed into the blood and penetrate into the lower Dantian. The grudge can hardly work.The strength of soldiers is not tenAnything under the sanctuary will surely attractAnd there is no antidoteOnly by long-term vindictiveness can we wipe out all poisonous drug properties.Refining: One gram of Hemolytic Poison Powder, 30 grams of Huangqi Fruit, 12 grams of white ginseng, 10 grams of turmeric, 15 grams of misty grass, 12 grams of Yunqi, 1 gram of bitterskin, 12 grams of YiyirenBlue Heart GrassFirst, take 12 parts of white ginseng, 15 parts of misty grass and 1 part of bitter husk. Put three kinds of materials into the medicine tank to carry out the fire, and stop when the white mist emitted from the misty grass dissipates.Then add the sauce into the jarInto the blue heart grass, yellow ginger, barley ... ... preservation method: ... ... this paper, all aspects of hemolytic drugs are very clearJust look at the refining processLei knows how hard it is to make so little hemolytic poison powderOne wrong step in this processThe whole effect is wrongThere are preservation methods, etc., everything should pay attentionThe same amount of hemolytic powder, but millions of times more expensive than gold coins."The eight materials in this hemolytic poison prescription are not scarce, and the price is not expensive for you.However, the other three kinds of materials are scarce. The misty grasses are generally found in the east of the four major empire of the Magnolia continent, namely the eastern prairie.Extremely rare, there is no marketAnd the other two materials, even more precious than the misty grass! Shisai said carefully."Whether it is blue heart grass or cloud grass, at least it is impossible to buy it.Belongs to the priceless marketIt is said that some time ago, some people bid 100,000 gold coins to buy blue heart grass, did not buyAnd the clouds have not appeared for a long time."Hisse patted shoulders of lei, comforted:" lei, you have to cobble together these eight kinds of materials, but it takes a little effort" lei heart is still a bit graspingOf these eight materials, five of them are a bit of a problemThe misty grass, though rareBut the difficulty of buying should not be muchThe blue heart grass...Do not need to go out and look forWhat is really difficult is just one kind of material - cloud! "Once the cloud worms got it again and ran out of hemolytic poison powder, it was the death of Clyde.Lei heart tunnelLei has been intolerable, if you can not find opportunities in the future, lei do not hesitate to reveal the identity, but also to kill clydeNo big deal, go and ask Yale for help, and escape the Holy Alliance through the Dawson Chamber of Commerce.With the power of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce, it would not be difficult for Lin Lei to escape the Holy Alliance."The most important thing now is to find the eight materials" lei is still very happy at the bottom of my heartAt least today's lei has a goal plan"Lin Lei, Lin Lei"Hissy shouted," Master lei! ""whatLei wake up from thinking, look at Xisse, "Mr. Xisse, what's the matter? "Xiceng laughed and said:" lei, are you not forgetting anything? Lei instantly responded, immediately laughed: "haha, shisai, you are talking about stone carving, right? The stone carving you asked for, I completed it as early as a month agoCome, follow meLei immediately took Cisse to the Pianhe HallI saw the ambiguousness in the side hall, and I was displaying a humanoid stone sculpture, the kind of indifference and murderousness.Looking at the omnipresent sense of arrogance in the eyes of those two eyes, people couldn’t help but look up at him.Even faced with this stone carving, it will make people feel scared<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> As far as appearance is concerned, it is almost the same, and it is almost the same"Okay, okay!!!" Seaside said two things in a row with excitement"Master leiYou are indeed a master of stone carving. Such a perfect work was completed in such a short time.In my mind, this work is 10,000 times better than dreaming."Xixe looked at this stone sculpture and smiled on his face.The more you look at this stone sculpture, the more happy Greek is, "This king of killing is not too narcissistic a bit?" lei looked at Gesese's face with a smile and thought in his heart"Lei adultsThe housekeeper's houseLei took out a piece of paper and handed it to the housekeeper: "You gave me out to purchase these twelve materials.""YesLei adultsThe butler took this paperTwelve kinds of materials are listed on this paper. Six of them are needed by lei. As for the other six, six kinds of ordinary materials that lei has casually written, of which only the misty grasses are more precious.As for the blue-hearted grasses and clouds that are needed for the hemolytic poisons, lei did not even write on paper at all.Lei is not worried about the name of this material leaked outAfter all, the hemolytic poison party is the secret of the killer's organization of death. I am afraid that no one knows this recipe except for the saber organization.And some other medicines that use those materials are normalAfter all, the most important two kinds of drugs are bluegrass and cloudworm."You bought me all kinds of herbs as soon as possible"Lin Lei entrusted the roadAfter instructing the steward, lei immediately sent someone to invite Yale, Renault and George to gather here.Lei four brothers have the opportunity or will often gatherLei will not be surprised to do thisThe next morningToday is the day when Canter & Debus hanged, but lei is too lazy to lookHe is drinking and chatting with his three good brothers at his own house. After the end of drinking, lei finally raises his business."Yale boss, I have something to please youLei said"The youngest, despite what I saidYale said boldlyLei took out the paper: “yale boss, I need two herbs, namely, misty grass and cloudThese two kinds of herbs are extremely rare and they cannot be purchased on the marketI want to ask Yale you for helpBehind Yale is the Dawson Chamber of CommerceAs one of the three largest Magnolia mainland chambers of commerceThe Dawson Chamber of Commerce is a giant, and the energy it possesses is amazingLet them go to find misty grass and clouds. The difficulty is much smaller."Two herbs? Rest assured, this little thing is wrapped in me"Yale, who had all the tongue to drink, patted his chest and pledgedAt the same time, they took papers from the list of linseed to record two herbs.“Mysterious grass, I saw it at home when I was youngA very fun herb that emits white mist under high temperaturesRenault said immediatelyLei eyes brightBut Renault’s home is in the Empire of O'Brien, from Renault’s home to the kingdom of Finlay, at least for a year.Lei could not wait for such a long timeUnless you can't find it later, you will have to wait patiently“When you wait for the misty grass in your fourth home, will you wait until you're there?” Yale said. “The youngest, I’ll go and find my uncle and let him help you find these two medicines.”"Yale's affair with lei is really very hard, and on that day he went to find his uncle."In an indestructible space between heaven and earth, Myron & Dawson, with their brown hair, are casually dressed in bathrobes, bare-chested and lying on a lounger next to the two most beautiful women in heaven and the world."Uncle, uncle!" Yale's voice rang out at the doorMyron reluctantly grinned and touched the two beautiful women's hair and smiled and said: "Baby, you two are waiting outside for a while."The two beautiful women walked out of the elegant room obediently, and Yale immediately came in."Yale, it's so big, it's not soMyron & Dawson frowned.Yale laughed and said: "Uncle, don't be angry. I came here today and there is one thing I ask for your help. It's about my good brother and my third child."" The third? That lei? "Myron sat up straight." "Yale took out the paper from his arms:" Uncle, the third child he needed these two herbs, so I asked you to help you, see if you can find"Say it, hand the paper over“Mysterious Grass, Clouds?” Myron & Dawson looked at the name and nodded slightly. “I'll send someone to see if there's any medicine here.""Haha, thank you, Uncle."Yale is excited." Then I don't bother you. Your good deeds, I'm going first.""This kidMyron & Dawson smiled and looked at the paper in the hand. "Dense fog, cloud? This lei to these two herbs do? Lei had to admit that the efficiency of Dawson Chamber of Commerce is really amazing"The youngest, we have only a small amount of stinking grass in the Dawson Chamber of Commerce branch.As for the cloud, there is still someJust now it was transported to the headquarters.
