Reynolds, George, and Yale trio looked at the stone sculpture. They were completely shocked by this stone sculpture. In their eyes, the five human figures of this stone sculpture seemed to have a soul—the humanoid stone carving on the leftmost side. The kind of softness and weakness that it contains is so provocative.The lovely and lively spirit in the second person-shaped stone carving is how excitingThe third personal stone carving is like a girl shy in front of herself... The five people in this stone sculpture have an independent charm.Lei stared at this stone sculpture, but there is a feeling of dreaming. These five shadows are memories of dreams, and now the dreams are awake."Lei"Drinking Watert walks over, and the white robe of the month is still spotlessLei looks at delincowaterThere is a gratifying expression on Drinkovt’s face: “Stone carving techniques, you have reached the height of the masterThis stone carving work of yours can be considered as the representative work of our 'Sword Knife School'.After this time, surely you have a deeper understanding of the stone carving.Lei nodded slightlyTo really accomplish such a work, Lin Lei really understands why some stone carving masters have only one or two pieces of their works.It's not that the masters of stone carvings are not capable enough, but...the real kind of works that can be called 'the works of God' are impossible to find.For example, LEI can complete the stone carving 'Wake up', but if you let him sculpt such a piece, it's hard for a strong man to do it.A stone carving called 'God' is born, it requires superb craftsmanship, wonderful inspiration and swayOnly have absolute **, integrate into 100%Only with unreserved feelings can we complete a shocking workLin Lei has now completed the stone carving 'Wake up,' but he has to complete another piece that is comparable to 'Wake up', but he does not know what time it will be.However, after ten days and nights of putting into sculpture, lei's mind has clearly remembered the wonderful realm. In the realm of sculpture, lei has actually improved.Now let lei sculpt a piece of work, although not as good as the stone carving 'wake up', but it is also much better than a stone carving worth five or six thousand gold coins."LEI, do you feel your spirit changes?" Drincowout proudly laughed.LEI YiyiMental strength? That is more than the vastness of spirit in the pastThe strength is much stronger than in the past. If it was ten days ago, the mental strength of the lei is just a small tree.Today, lei's spiritual power is a lush tree"How to increase so much?" Lei was shockedDeling Kewater smiled proudly and his white beard looked warped: "Ten times! Your spiritual power in just ten daysThe horror has been improved, and it is ten times as early as ten days ago! Just ten days to catch up with others practicing for decades, your spiritual power directly from the beginning of the sixth magician, jumped to the level of seven magicianLei also felt a bit incredibleThe increase is too much, ten times! "The effect is very good, right? Well, the flat knife genre sculpture I created by Drinkwater, the effect is beyond doubt.But... I really envy you"Drincowwater narrowed his eyes with a smile.""LeiYou should know that integrating absolute feelingsThe state of complete and natural fit of the soul is very rare and very rareLei noddedIf that kind of state is easy to enter, I'm afraid that God's work is not uncommon."I lived nearly 1,300 yearsAnd I only entered that state three times and completed three of my most proud works."Drincowwater has a pride on his face, and immediately said:" But I carved those three works and spent two days, four days, and three days.It takes only nine days to add up. It is less than once for you."Lin Lei also heard that De Lin Kewot said that he spends ten days and ten nights"This state of affairs is the fastest state of spiritual power created by the genre sculptures of the Knives. In that state, I am afraid that it is more than a thousand times that of ordinary people. This state is the state we dream of.Staying in this state, the longer the time, the better, so the bigger the carved stone, the more benefits you get.Lei admitted in the heartThe stone carving 'Wake up' is a giant stone sculpture that sculpts out five characters. This is a very rare large stone sculpture.Derlin Kewot sighed: "But when inspiration and buzz came, there was already a carved model in the brain and there was no choice at all.Lei also understand in mindIt was like when I saw the rock, I saw the lines and the emotions of my own thoughts.When that kind of time comes, the forgotten world forgets itself and only knows the stone carving! All the spirits and all the feelings are on the stone sculptures.When I entered that state, there was no other way of thinking about 'I would like to refine a giant stone carving'. I couldn't be distracted. When I was distracted, that state was destroyed."LEI, I would like to ask, what's your name for this work?" asked Delincottwater."AwakeLei repliedDrinkovt tasted a moment in his heart, and then nodded slightly: "Yes, good name."The rare snow had already stopped. There was a white space between the heavens and the earth. There was a thick layer of snow on the ground behind the whole mountain. It was enough to bury it in the knees. Such a big snowfall was still rare."After the heavy snowfall, the temperature dropped sharplyYale, George, and Renault, who were in the cold weather, had a tent directly next to them. Yale ordered some people to bring food. They just watched the lei.At this moment, the Yale trio exclaimed for this piece of lei."Yale boss, the youngest are now carving success, he also stood in front of the stone carving?" Renault said with some worries, they did not know that lei is in the soul exchange with Drincowwater, Drew Corwater is the soul Form exists, they can't seeYale shook his head slightly: "I don't knowHowever, this third-grade work can definitely be compared with that of Prouks."<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> At least in Yale's eyes, this work by lei is so shocking"Yale boss, second child, fourth childLei sounded unexpectedly, this is to make Yale, George, Renault three slight glimpse, Renault exclaimed more excitedly: "lei, you are finally speaking, for a full eleven days, eleven days whatYou don’t eat or drink for eleven daysLei stood still in front of the boulders for a day, the sculpture took another ten days and ten nightsIt is indeed a full 11 daysIf it is some ordinary people, it will be dead for eleven days without food or drink.It is the average of the 4 or 5 levels of magician who do not eat or drink for eleven days. It is also very weak and weak.However, lei is only a little hunger now, but the body is not the slightest discomfortBecause into that special state, and when it is completely in harmony with nature, the elements of the ground and the elements of the wind continue to flow into his body to supplement energy consumption, and they constantly improve the physique of the lei."I have been hungry for eleven days.Lei said with a smile"Hungry?" George rushed to the tent not far from here.Take out two large boxes wrapped in furThe fur is insulation, unfurling the furInside it is a box of ironOpen two iron boxes, which are rich dishes"Wait a minute, how can I not drink at dinner?" Yaluhaha laughed.Lei looked at his three good brothersOne is ready for rice and the other is pouredLook at their busy appearance, lei suddenly felt very warmEleven days so accompanied with their own, how can LEI heart not move? Only lei buried everything in his heart and buried it deeply"Boss, second child, fourth child, we are good brothers throughout our lives.Lei said firmly in the heart"The youngest, come and eat soon"Georgia said passionately"it is goodLei and their three good brothers in such a vast mountain after the snow, so eat and drink, laughter and constant laughter, the shadow mouse' babe' is also excited to eat and drink next to itAfter eating"Yale boss, this stone carving you saved for meLei rose and stood up, looked around, surrounded by a vast snow-colored sky, "when I was 15 years old went to trials of the mountains of warcraft, according to the truth 16 years of age in July and August when I have to go out trials , but at that time I didn’t try it because of Alice’s relationship. Now I’ve decided to go to the World of Warcraft, try it out for a while."Yale, George, Renault"The youngest, are you going to the Mountain of Warcraft?" Yale is anxious, George and Renault are anxiousIn their view, lei had just experienced a blow. Now there are 11 days of no food or drink. Just after a good mood, he has to go to the entire fierce land of the Magnolia mainland, the "Mountain of Warcraft."Lei laughed and said: "Well, you don't worry, I'm very sensible nowIf I haven’t gotten out of the shadows, this stone carving 'wake up' will destroy it."Turn to look at stone carvings," Wake up." Looking at this stone sculpture, lei seems to see his days of the past year, and now lei's heart is as quiet as ever"That's just a memory, it's just a setback in life.Because of Alice, the pace of my cultivation has slowed down. Now I can no longer delay.Lei smiled at the Yale trio and took up his own parcel. "I'm not going back to the college and setting off directly."""The boss, the second child, the old fourthLei eyes condensed his three good brothers and smiled. "Thank you so much. I'm very fortunate, lei, you guys like thisAfter completing the package, lei took the babe and marched towards the east on the trail of snow.Yale, Renault, and George looked at lei more and more and finally disappeared into the snow-colored world.Amongst the Warcraft MountainsTowering trees, dense thorns, messy wildflowers and weeping fallen leaves, the whole of Warcraft is still so primitive, lei sat cross-legged in the middle of the grass, absorbing the outside world of the ground, the wind element refining Magic powerAlthough lei's spiritual power has reached the level of seven wizards, magical power is still six levels.Lei has entered the world of warcraft for a whole monthDuring this month, lei occasionally kills some of Warcraft. At other times, it is not studying the wind's seventh-level magical 'flying technique', that is, practicing meditation in meditation.Ernst Magic School does not teach seven levels and higher magic at allBut 'flying' and 'floating' are almost a simple extension. lei has been experimenting with flying magic spells based on books on the principles of wind magic that are read in the college library.For a whole month of trials, lei can easily fly between heaven and earth.Although lei did not know whether the magic spells he studied were the same as the 'flying technique' magic spells that the outside world had stipulated, but today's flying speed, lei is also considered satisfactory.The sixth-level magician to the seventh-grade magician is indeed a big hurdle, but the hardest part of this big hurdle is the improvement of spiritual power. Today, lei has improved its spiritual power, and the refining of magic power only takes enough time.LEI's elemental affinities are all superior, and the magical power of refining is extremely fast.Shadow Mouse 'Bebe' looks around lei, carefully protects lei, while lei is quietly refining the magic powerLei body chest in the pubic regionThe yellowish fog and the blue fog are already thick, but now there are still yellowish gases and blue gas entering the middle and middle fields. As the density becomes bigger and bigger, finally, the fog in Dantian reaches a limit.A drop of yellowish liquid droplets and a drop of blue liquid droplets appeared in the middle of the leiThen, more and more khaki and blue liquid droplets change from one to ten, one hundred, and one thousand... One difference between the sixth-level magician and the seventh-level magician is that—the magic begins. liquefaction!
