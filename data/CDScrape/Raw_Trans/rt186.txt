The light of the fire shines, and all the people's faces are dark and bright, and the bloody atmosphere is still filled with it. But the two people who were just killing looked at the meaty body and looked again. Look at the lei carrying the black tactical swordOne of the eight strongest ah, even a sword was killedThis...unbelievable! "Brothers, go, kill these robbers!!!" The furious Malone first reacted and shouted in excitement. "Kill these bastards and take revenge for the dead brother!" The robbers listened. The cries of the long-bearded Marlon were all awake.Their chief ‘one-eyed’ McKinley was killed by a swordDon’t say that those mercenaries are guarding, and the man with the epee is enough to sweep them."Revenge, revenge, kill"The mercenary guards were all eyes shining and the impetus was fully up.One by one, they rushed up with weapons.“Get away!” the robbers shouted, fleeing and fleeing one after another.The archers of the mercenary guards immediately opened their bows, looked indifferently at the fleeing figures, and fired arrows at speed. “噗哧”, “噗哧”...the six robbers were pierced by bows and fell to the ground.The remaining 70-odd people disappeared in the dark curtain in the distanceThe mercenary guards did not pursue it. They just returned after chasing 100 meters. After all, their mission was to protect the team.“Call!” The team’s businessmen and pedestrians were relieved one by one.But the mercenary guards didn’t look good, one by one to collect the bodies of a dozen mercenaries who died."We continue to restMa Long LangAt this time, many people in the mercenary guards were injured. They must be treated well.Hundreds of people in the team were quiet and returned to their respective placesPeople who run outside for a long time often encounter such thingsIt won't make a big deal******* A group of campfires ignited, and the body of dozens of mercenary soldiers was buried under the desolate land by the road. The mercenaries who scuttled their lives may die at any time. Once they die, the bodies Are buried in placeOther mercenary members brought back some of their relicsLei with a heavy sword, relying on a big tree beside the road watching the mercenaries quietly"Lei Daren"Many businessmen in the team ran over to show gratitude to lei.Even some people donated gold coins to Lin Lei, and Lin Lei declined."Brothers, good to goMarlon yelledAll mercenaries are standing in front of those graveyardsUnite in a big giftIn the mercy of the mercenary, death is very normalThe mercenaries returned one by oneThe leader of this mercenary team, the bearded 'Maron' came to LEI with Lands and Luther, and he said gratefully: 'I'm glad to thank you, if this time is not you, our servant Soldiers team..." Talking about this, Marlon shook his head"Rego, this timeYou saved our mercenary group"The young Luther is also gratefulRegardless of the previous reminder, or the last shotCan be considered to have saved their mercenary regiment"No need toLei said lightly"Lei Da Ren, this is ten thousand gold coins.Marlon removed a magic crystal card from his arms. "This magic crystal card is not registered, and there are 10,000 coins in memory."Lei, you must acceptIf this time is not you, our entire mercenary group will not complete the task, I am afraid that it will be impossible to survive.Lei smiled and shook his head"Rego, you accept it"Lands immediately persuaded that the mercenary lineMost of them are very pridefulThese mercenaries who are on the verge of life and death are particularly heavy with loyalty and grace."Do you think I'm like a lack of money?" lei looked at the three peopleLei's space ring full of twenty-two 100 million gold coins magic crystal card2.2 billion gold coins, this huge figure is that the Dawson Chamber of Commerce will not easily come up withSome families in the four great empire are powerful, and money is good enoughBut they are terrible, but they can't keep up with the royal family in a kingdom.After all, some of the big four big empireStill have to hand in a lot of money to the emperorThe Kingdom of Finland, compared to those big families, has much more autonomy.Accumulated for thousands of years... This wealth has reached a scary pointMa Long listened to lei and said so, he didn't insist on it, he would not dare to go with the strong leiAnd it's not easy for the mercenaries to make money. "Marlon Chief, you go and take care of your mercenaries. I see a lot of people are not injured.Lei said"That Ray adults please rest, I left firstMalong respectfully said that the strong are respected everywhereBonfire burningMost people in the entire team could not sleep, one by one around the campfire, except for a few people sleeping, others are talking about the battle just now.From time to time, there are still many people who cast their eyes on lei, clearly the object of discussion is lei.Lei is sitting cross-legged at the moment, quietly feeling the depths of the land, feel the wind filled the worldAfter three years of cultivation in the Mountain of Warcraft, lei also learned more about cultivation.Whether it is the practice of warriors or the practice of a magician, it is ultimately necessary to feel natural.It's just likeThat McKinley is actually an eighth-level warrior, and lei is also an eight-level warrior.But in the realmMcGinley is still in a simple attack technique, and lei has reached the third level, and it can pressure people.This potential is the trend of heaven and earth.Sword out, can affect the space aroundThe gap between the two is too great. It is not surprising that a sword was killed."If I didn't forget everything in the Warcraft Mountains, I was completely immersed in nature for three years.I am afraid that in such places in Hess City, <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> is hard to raise in the realm."Lin Lei underground channelThe people in the team whispered about lei, but lei could be as quiet as practicing.“Ray, Ray?” a slightly shy voice rang from the sideLei heard the sound and turned around. It was the gentle little gentleman who wore it, the aristocrat ‘Kien’, and a smile on her face: “Keaneright? What's matter? Keen heard lei call him his name and was very proud in his heart. He whispered: "I'm a big man, I have a request.""Sit down and say” lei's attitude makes Kean slightly relax, also sat down beside lei, eyes lei watched lei said: “lei adult, just a good sword you, I was bullied since childhood, I also want to be Powerful warriorCan you teach me? Lei leiWarrior cultivation is not a day or twoIt takes years of hard work, but also requires good talent, plus good teachers. The addition of the three will create a strong person."It's a bit difficult, and I don't have enough time to teach youLei said with a smileGinn shook his head and waved his head in a hurry: "No, Lei, I don't want to learn too much.Do not be too powerfulAs long as you learn your sword, just the sword"Speaking, Keane is dancing and demonstrating just now."As long as you learn that sword?" lei laughedJust now that sword looked simple, but it was lei's ten years of hard work, coupled with the realization of the soul, eventually comprehending the 'potential', not to mention the eight-level warrior, is generally nine soldiers, I am afraid it is also very Difficult to comprehend what is 'potential'According to the records of the Baruch family, the ancestor who used the hammerAt the time of reaching the sanctuary level, it was only realized that ‘weaving is lighter’, and only a few decades after reaching the sanctuary, did they realize that the 'potential’The magician, who is inherently more natural than a warrior, feels more naturallyA soldierIn order to understand the difficulty of ‘potential’, it’s harder to compare lei as a magician and warrior."Yes, it's hard? I'm not afraid"Keanelian saidKeaneA soft voice began to sound. Jenny, who was a pale blue, ran over and was holding a robe in her hand. She said to Keane caringly.Keane grinned and turned away: "No"Jenny's brow can't help but she can't help her brother.Keane went on to say: "SisterYou see, Lei Deren wears a thin undershirt. I wear so much and let me wear it."Keane dumbfounded. This Keane actually took his own ratio, that is, in the winter, lei did not care about that coldNot to mention now"Keane, wear it.Lei said in aloudLei seems to be more useful than jenny's words"Oh"Keane took over the clothes in the hands of Gianni. Zhanni looked gratefully to lei: "thank you to thunder.Lei smiled and noddedJenny just glance at leiThe face is slightly redHowever, lei accidentally noticed Jenny's hands, but this look is surprising leiAccording to lei's observationThis jenny is undoubtedly a noble ladyBut Jenny’s hands are rough“Keane, don’t disturb Ray’s elder people for too long. Lei’s adults also need rest."Jenny's apologetic smile on Lin Lei, his face reddishly returned to his own carriage.Lei looks at Keane“Keane, does your sister need to work at home?” lei is puzzled. The hand of a typical noble lady is very delicate.But this Miss Jenny is dressed regardless of temperament, absolutely nobility.But her hand... Kean nodded and said, “Yeah, Lei, do not you look at me wearing this way. Actually, I myself feel awkward to wear. I haven’t worn it for so long.Keane said, pulling the collar. "Actually, my sister and I were in the ordinary town."When Grandpa Lambert takes care of us, my sister usually still has to do housework.""Oh? Lei puzzled, "but your sister's behavior, unlike the ordinary country girl ahKeane nodded. "It's normal. Our father is a town in the county of O'Brien.When we were young, we lived in the Shrine. When I was six years old, my mother, my sister, and me were all driven out by my aunt.My mother took us back to her hometownWhen my sister was a kid, she was educated by aristocrats. When she left home, her sister was ten years old.The aristocratic habits are naturally maintainedBut I'm young and my mother's body is poorGrandfather Lambert did not take care of us alone, so her sister did chores when she was young, and my sister’s housework would be done."I remember that in the winter, my sister's hands were cracked, but I could still cook for us."I want to help, my sister will not let"Keane licked his lips and his eyes were a little red." This time, I went to inherit the position of the city's lord and must not allow my sister to do housework anymore. I also need a large group of people to serve my sister.Lei listened, but also some admire jani this looks very weak and shy girl"You want to inherit the position of the landlord. Didn't you let the aunt get out?" lei inquiredKeane also did not hide: "My aunt had tried to drive us out to let his son inherit the place of the Lord.It's a pity... His junk son is desperate to drink. After my father died shortly afterwards, her junk son is more than happy and carefree.I heard that some days ago, I died on the belly of a woman.He died, naturally let me inherit the position of the Lord."Keane looked at lei eagerly." lei adults, you teach me, wait for me to be a lord, must arrange for you as a very tall official"(Chapter 1 to!)
