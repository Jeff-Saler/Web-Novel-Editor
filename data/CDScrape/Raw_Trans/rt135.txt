At this moment, Lin Lei is obviously just bathing.The hair is wet and the body is casually dressed in loose robes."You all sit down.Lei sat comfortably on the main seat and said with a wave of randomNimitz and other six people immediately thanked and sat down one by one.Nimitz first smiled and said: "I'm an adult, lei, we're here this time.Thank you, lei.If it weren’t for you, Kalan was probably not able to come out so soon.Kalan, but thank you, lei adultsKa Lan had to stand up at this time, his heart suppressed the resentment of his heart, and tried to make his attitude humility: "Thank you, lei adults.Lei smiled at the card blue: "card blueno need to thank me"" Mr. Nimitz, I have important things after a while. I don't know what you have. If you have something, please say it earlier.Lei laughed and looked at nimitzIn fact, lei is too lazy to waste time with these people. His time is used for cultivation.Nimitz gave a glimpse, but he adjusted it in an instantA low sigh and said: “I’m an adult lei, I’m defiled by the Debus family and I’m suspected of smuggling Shuiyu ore.At this time of this day, the Debus couples may fall apart.So we Debus family asked lei adults to helpOnce our family has passed this difficult time, we will never forget the great grace of lei adults."SpeakingNimitz took a black box from the side“I’m an adult lei, this is a gift we give to adults. Thanks for being able to save Karan from prison. If our family can save this time, we will definitely thank lei adults again."Nimiz sincerely holds this black box and looks at lei.""call out"The shadow mouse babe unexpectedly went to Nimitz in front of a surprise, even two small claws directly took over the black box, directly jumped to the lei's leg, directly to open this black box“BebeLei whisperedBebe looked up and looked at lei with dissatisfaction, they did not open the box, stunned a few times, they did not say anything"Mr. Nimitz, Bebe is a bit unruly. I accepted this present. Thank you, Mr. Nimitz's kindness.Lei smiled and put the black box on the side, looking at it without a glanceNimitz felt a little impatient with leiImmediately, Nimitz made a wink at other people. He took the lead and stood up and said, "If you are an adult, then we will not bother the adults. The Debuss family case will be tried a month later. I hope During this time, adults can helpLei nodded at randomA few Nimitz then left, from beginning to end, Alice, Rowling and they were silent, mainly Nimitz spoke alone.Visually watching this group of people leave, lei smiled coldly: "Niimiz this old guy? Bring Alice, think I will give you face?" Lin Lei opened the lid next to the black box with one hand, the inside of the box There is a magic crystal card and a letter"Letter?" lei hand holding this letter, but suddenly lei fired in the hands of the flame directly burned this letter to the ashesThis letter, lei is too lazy to seeIn an instant, it entered SeptemberThis month, lei practiced assiduously every day. The body's flexibility and strength have been greatly improved in all aspects. The blood pressure in the body is also increasingly refined.Lei has a feeling, he has reached the end of sixAs for the progress of spiritual power, although the progress of lei is very fast, but from the seven magician to the eighth magician, is the genius character, generally takes nearly two decades to workEven though lei is advancing quickly, progress is still not obvious for several months.The magic path is really long and hardIn the spring water park, with knife-shadows waving, a humanoid stone sculpture has become increasingly clear, abandoned stones have been scattered and fallen onto the grasslands.Suddenly lei stopped and the knife was put away"Call, finally finished"Looking at the stone in front of his eyes, lei nodded with satisfaction.This is named after the king of the lei killed stone carving, it is indeed a great effort to consume leiLei is trying every time to completely enter the stateThe scene that Hickey shot perfectly carved out<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Stone carving in front of you, height and real lifeEspecially the indifference and indifference between the two eyes, it makes people feel a sense of God.This stone sculpture gives a feeling of killingAnd being stared at by this stone eagle is even more frightening."This work, though not as awakeBut it also reached the most perfect realm under normal circumstances.Lei for this workStill extremely satisfiedIt took nearly a month to sculpt carefully and finally completedPut down the flat knife, lei soaked in the spring water pool, then put loose clothes on the chairEating a maid sent breakfast"Lei"Drincowwater flew out from the side"Grandpa DelinLei looks at delincowaterDelin Kewotte laughed: "Lee, there are two days, is the case of the Debusi family trial, are you ready to see it?" "The case trial?" LEI YiyiThis month's hard-working cultivating life made Lin Lei forget the things outside.Even the case of the Debuss family had forgottenIf it wasn’t for Delingikewater, lei would never think of it"Go, of course goLei has a smile on his faceMagnolia Calendar September 8, 9999, City of Fenlai, Heisui FuchuBlackwater prison is the most famous in Kingdom of FinlayIs also the guard of the most severe prisonThe Blackwater House is the top site of the auditing case in the City of Finlay.A large number of nobles gathered today in the Heishui courtEven the King Clyde had come to watchAnd lei naturally comes today"Lei adults"A nobleman greeted with lei enthusiastically"Lei, comeSit hereClyde, sitting in front of the gallery, beckoned to lei.Lei smiled at ClydeAlso walked pastLei and clyde sat togetherThe shiny Merritt hair comb sits on the chairWaist rod is straightIt really gives a sense of fairness and selflessness"Please take a seat"Merritt nodded to the numerous nobles in the gallery, and Meryl especially showed a humble smile in the direction of Clyde and lei."Many aristocrats in the auditorium fell silent. The Debuss family also came to more than a dozen people today. The dozen or so people are sitting nervously waiting for the start of the trial."With Bernard"Merritt said directlyJust for a moment, under the escort of two sergeants, Bernard, with his ankle bracelet, finally entered the trial chamber.Merritt took a glance at an officer next to him. The officer stood up consciously and began to say aloud, "Duke Padson made many betrayal of the kingdom during his tenure as the Minister of Finance.Among them, it is alleged that they jointly smuggled Shuiyu ore with the Debus family, which is a large scale. It is the Shuiyu ore that I have never investigated since the founding of the Kingdom of Finlay. It has already been investigated for smuggling. The value is nearly 50 million gold coins! Actually, the Debusi family smuggling has just begun. It is worth 50 million gold coins. The Debus family actually spent millions of gold coins.This shows that smuggling profitsBut this smuggling has only just begun. Because Padson’s death, it caused this thing to leak out.The official continued: "After investigation, it was the people who presided over the smuggling. One of them jumped into the river, while the other two were brothers of Lancel and Lanmir.After that, the official sat downMerritt looked at Bernard: "What do you have to say about Bernard?" Bernard nodded. "Yes, an adult, first smuggling is not the Debus family, second, Lansir. Both brothers have long been expelled by the Debus family.Thirdly, the person who is really responsible for smuggling should be someone you call someone who jumps into the river.It has nothing to do with my Debus family"Meili character laughed and said:" The host of smuggling is your younger brother. Do you still say that's okay? "" Three brothers? My younger brother travels on adventures outside, how can I host smuggling?Bernard still insists on this"Your younger brother is adventurous?" Merritt faced a cold face, "then I ask you, if your third brother is out of the adventure, then I let you Debusi family to recall your third brother, why are you three brothers for so long Didn't come back?” Bernard said: “My third brother has traveled in other countries and may be running too far. It’s normal to contact less than a year and a half."Merritt looked at Bernard, smiled, and then coldly said:" Take Catson three people up""Carson? Bernard wondered at the bottom of his mind. What were these three Catssons? Just three moments, three young people who were afraid of shrinking walked up and immediately came down and bowed down and respectfully said: "Meeting adultsThe three young people are obviously civilians who have never seen the worldMerritt said indifferently: "Carson, you made clear what you first discovered."" Yes, adults“The young people headed by the respected people said,” On the day of June 28th, our three brothers were fishing on rivers, but suddenly we found a gorgeous nobleman who was holding a piece of dead wood floating along with rivers and rivers. Adults have blood and are almost unconscious"Heard this, Bernard's face has changed a bit.“The day we were killing the leader of the smuggling party, it was June 28, and he happened to have jumped into that river."Merritt looks at Bernard," Bernard, can you confess? ""My younger brother went out on an adventure and never hosted smuggling."The Debus family is absolutely innocentBernard said this timeMerritt sneers and says: "Bring up with Cante & Debus"When I heard the name Kanter & Debus, Bernard and the Debuss family in the gallery suddenly turned white.(Today's Pomodoro is in poor condition and can only be updated in one chapterTomorrow's tomato replenishment! )
