A familiar voice soundedIn the living room, lei turned to look outside the house, and saw Yale, Renault and George three ran in first.After lei suffered a double blow in a short time, the gloomy mood can be imagined.You can see the three brothers who grew up together at the Ernst Magic School from childhood, and Lin Lei could not help but smile.After entering the living room, Yale, George, and Renault all had their heads on the central floor."The youngest, I got your father's death message last night."Even the second and fourth were given to the oldestI guess there must be many nobles coming todaySo it also brought several chefs in the city of Finlay to rush in overnight.Yale whispered"Thank youLei also guessed that their three brothers are in a hurryConvene a chef to prepare the teamRenault and George probably still rushed to the city of Finlay from the Ernst Magic School, eventually rushing in with Yale late at night."The youngest, don't be too sad"George gently patted the lei shouldersRenault also stood beside Lin Lei: "Lei LeiNo matter when, you have our three brothersNo matter what happens, you don't get knocked down, strongLei looked at Renault, a smile on his faceThe most unruly Renault actually said such words, and lei felt warm in his heart.After all, no matter what time, he still has three good brothers."thank you allLei glanced at Yale. "The Yale boss, to entertain those aristocrats, gave you help. I have no experience with these."Yale nodded: "Rest assured, I brought a lot of people here."This reception work will surely do a good job“...The quiet town of Wushan is no longer calm today. The residents of Wushan town gathered in a row in twos and threes and talked to each other about the luxury fleet that was just there."In the morning, the team has hundreds of horses. The carriage is also very luxurious.That mighty knight, really... I have never seen such a luxury team in my life.An old man admired the team outside the Baruch familyThe residents nearby also nod their headsIn ordinary towns, they usually have the opportunity to see the kind of luxury teamA few days ago when Lin Lei came back, a cavalry team brought a long discussion to this ordinary town."You said, did the youngest lord outside do a big aristocrat?" a woman guessed. "I saw it two days ago, the young Master LEI returned with a strong cavalry team."Ushan Town heard people talk about it all morningHowever, around the middle of the eleventh hour, when the ground vibrated, the residents of Wushan Town felt the dense and tidy horseshoe sound.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>This hoof is far more powerful than the previous Yale teamDressed in armor of light, a powerful cavalry team rushes forwardBehind are two very luxurious carriages.

This made the residents of Wushan town outside to make a noise.It turned out to be the red cardinal! In the eyes of the civilians of the Holy Alliance, the Archbishop of the Holy See, the red cardinalIn their heartsThe red cardinal is just like the stars in the night sky.But not to climbBut today, the two red cardinals came to this small place in Wushan town."Boom!" "Boom!" "Boom!"Not long after the Red Cardinal's team came in, it was a large-scale team that was not much different in size. This team was even more extravagant and maidservant than the red archbishop’s team. It was like a woman. Court waiterThat golden yellow luxury carriageThe mighty knights demonstrated their superb riding skills. The uniform horseshoe sounded like a drummer ringing in the hearts of residents of Wushan Town.The residents of Wushan Town are stupid"These, these big guys?"

What happened? Today, so many high-class people gathered in this ordinary Osan. The residents of the town of Wushan also guessedIf there is anything serious in Wushan Town, Hogg is dead.But Hogge is just a nobleman of a small town. It will cause the king of a kingdom to squat, and the red cardinal of the Holy See will come. These residents could not help but think of the grand scene that Lin Lei led back a cavalry team the other day."All this is estimated to be related to the young master of leiAlthough these ordinary residents do not know lei's things, but they also guess itIn the living room of the Baruch family’s residence, lei lays asideThe Archbishop of Red, the Majesty the King, the Duke, the Marquis, the Earl, etc. are all nobles or beggars, or kneel down in good faith.Although Archbishop Gilmer and others are only embarrassed, they can make them embarrassed.But today, Hoggar died."lei, don't be too sadGilmer said gently around lei"Thank you!" lei slightly bent Xie Li"LEI, your father's death is really regrettableClyde comforted him too.after a while"lei, don't be too sad"Clarity soundedLei looked up and looked in the past, wearing a plain clothes delia is looking at him, face care"Thank youLei said softlyDelia slightly nodded and was led by servants to the side, one by one aristocrats successively in this worship leiEven the chief of the Debus family, Bernard, came to pay a visit to Lin Lei’s father."Master lei, don't be too sadBernard said with courtesyLei is still thankful to salute: "thank you!" ... "the kingdom of filipe duke of the Kingdom of finland, to --" suddenly sounded outside the doorLin Lei brow slightly wrinkledThe death of his father was related to this Paderson.However, lei also knows that his father is to change his appearance and dive into the residence of the duke. I'm afraid that Paderson still does not know lei's father, that is, the person who was severely injured by his man and finally died.Padson looks very much like Clyde, the same long blond hair, eyes like the eyes of the Blue Thunder Eagle, the whole person straight, has a noble momentumPadson comes to the living room and pays respectfully to Hoggar's spirit to worship."Master lei, don't be too sadPaderson walked beside Lin Lei and said sincerelyLei looked up at Padson and looked at Padson's friendly and sincere eyes. He still said in courtesy: "Thank you!" From the surface, it is impossible to see how RAY treats Padson and others differently.
