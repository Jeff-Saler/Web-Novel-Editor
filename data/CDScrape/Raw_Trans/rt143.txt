Lei looked cautiously on both sides and whispered: "Your Majesty, please wait, I will be outside the screenThen, lei walked toward the door and shouted directly to the two guards outside the hall: "You all go out without my orders. No one is allowed into the yard.""" Yes, lei adultsThe two guards left respectfully, and suddenly there were only LEI, Clyde, Merritt, and Ransom in the entire"Oh!Lei quietly closed the door"lei, what is so mysterious, but also closed the door?" Clyde said with a smileLei looked at this clyde glance, heart sneerHe knew very well that this Clyde had already been poisoned by hemolysis, but that the hemolytic poison had no harm to the body, but only hindered the vindictive operation.As long as you don’t run a grudge, you won’t find that you’ve already had a hemolytic poison."This thing is really importantLei face is solemnBut Ransom was quietly close to Clyde at the moment. Ransom was a king's personal waiter. He felt that the environment at the moment was a bit of a threat, although, in the eyes of Ransom, the strength of his nine strong players, plus his eight Strong class strengthNo one threatens them hereYou can be careful that there is no big mistake"His MajestyLei solemnly looked at Clyde. "My mother died when I was very young."Clyde nodded, he checked the life story of lei, lei's mother is born lin lei younger wold and hard to produce dead"In my memory, I didn't feel any care from my mother.In my memory, there are only severe fathers. My father is very strict with me, whether it is the training of soldiers or the knowledge education of nobles.My father is very demanding and very strictLei looked at Clyde and said slowlyClyde was a bit puzzled. He didn't understand what lei said about it. What does it have to do with the so-called important things?However, as a king, Clyde did not interrupt lion with great grace."Surely you know you knowMy Baruch family is the Dragon Blood Warrior familyLei face has a look of pride"Yes, Dragon Blood Warrior Family, one of the four ultimate warrior familiesThis is a very brilliant old familyClyde praisedLei shook her head and said: "it was only glorious in the past. My family has declined to even the treasures of the family heritage. It has been gone for hundreds of years.The ancestors of my Baruch family all wanted to recapture the treasure of inheritanceCan always be destroyedYour Majesty, you know I was admitted to Ernst Magic College. On the day I left home, what did my father say to me? ""What did you say? Clyde looked at lei"My father said if I don't recapture the family inheritanceHe will not forgive me for his death! Lei shook slightlyClyde, Merritt, and even Lansheim, are not blinded by their eyesA father actually said such things to his son"Your father is too muchSaid Clyde"Do not"Lei shook his head solemnly." I understand my father's wish in my heart that my Dragon Blood Warrior family has been indulging for hundreds of years. No real strongman has appeared for hundreds of years."My father understandsI will be the strongest in the family for hundreds of yearsThe hope of the family for hundreds of years is on meDo you say that my father will tolerate my failure? Clyde understands a bit"My father's hope for a lifetimeIt is hoped that this sword will return to the familyLei sounds more fierce"I have not dared to relax at Ernst Magic SchoolDesperately practicingI always remember my father's hope, my father's trust! "The Clyde trio also understands what lei thinks"After half a year ago, after I had a dream stone auction, I went back. That time, I slaughtered me with a sword.Lei voice up highClyde, Ransom, and Merritt also missedBecause they know that this time, lei’s father is dead“But when I was excited to go back and meet me, it was the news that my father was dead. He did not see the sword but he did not see him on the morrow. I didn’t even see my father’s last time.I practice hard for so many years, I hope my father can be happy, but unfortunately ... ..." Lin Lei's face muscles began to twitch up, his face is very scaryClyde three people also understand the feelings of lei in the heart"lei, don't be too sadClyde sighedLei smiled coldly: "But you know how my father died?" Clyde, Merritt, Ransom all have a glimpse of"My father, is your brother, your father, Paderson killed!!!!" lei eyes began to red"What!" Clyde shocked, and Merritt and Ransom next to him were taken aback."So, I killed Paderson!" lei sounded hazyAt this time, Lansheim first felt that the atmosphere in the room was wrong, and he did not rest assured that he was leaning against Clyde.Always guard against leiHowever, at this time, Lansheim felt a gust of wind. Lansheim, as an eight-level strongman, knew that he would not be able to turn around and only had to arm to stop."Oh!" a violent pain passed, and Lansheim could not feel the existence of his own hands.At this time, Ransom’s corner of the eye also noticed that a half-meter-long rat in the shape of a gopher was full of blood in front of him. In addition to the bloody tusks, he noticed That fast swinging clawsAt this close range, Ransom simply has no time to dodgetoo fast! ! ! “噗哧"The claws directly cut the throat of Ransom, Lansheim looked at this scene, his eyes gradually dimmed."How did he not understand that when this one-half-meter-long mouse was born,He first observed the room at the first time he entered the room.He just noticed that there was only a palm-sized shadow mouse on the carpet.Is there a threat to a large black shadow mouse? <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Ransom was not alert to this, and in the absence of preparation, Langsheim’s eighth-ranked strongman was so easily killed by the shadowy babe.In fact, he did not die, with the strength of Beibei.Even if Lansheim is facing a battle, I'm afraid he can't stop a few strokes.“LansemClyde and Merritt are both shockedDignified eight strong, even if one face is deadBoth of them were shocked to look at the Warcraft movie mouseUnder their gaze, the shadowed rat beibei shrinks and returns to palm sizeFinally jumped to the shoulders of lei“BebeDoing wellLei stroked a little head of babeBebe narrowly enjoyed his eyesLei turned to continue to look at Clyde, cold eyes so that Clyde was shocked"LEI, what are you going to do?" Clyde cried coldly, and Clyde was also vindictive.But at this time, Clyde felt the usual normal meridians.It seems to be completely blocked nowadaysWith Clyde's nine strong players, they used to be able to run like waves, but now they can only struggle to run like a creek.And the vindictiveness is sometimes interruptedAt the moment Clyde vindictively, I am afraid that only one percent of the full period"Your Majesty, don't cry, don't resistRebellion is deathLei said indifferentlyClyde understands his situation instantlyNow that he may only rely on power, with his current strength he can barely catch up to a six-level warrior.But the little mouse on the shoulder of LEIEven the eight-ranked strong Lansmine can instantly killClyde did not doubt, lei and his WarcraftHave the ability to kill him instantly"lei, dare youDo you dare to assassinate your majesty? "In horror, Merritt shouted"To shut upLei glanced coldly at MerrittMerritt's strength is not strongNow that vindictiveness is almost completely incapable of running, his mortal forces can barely catch up to a fourth-level fighter.Merritt also suddenly understood her situationDo not dare to yell at lei, but still persuaded: "lei, you have a great future, in the future, you become a high-level glorious church, maybe in the future may also become the new bright popeBut why do you have to make a decision now? Lei, I believe, your majesty must not blame you for killing Paderson'sHe dealt with your father, he was"Said Merritt also looks at ClydeClyde also nodded: "LEI, this time, I can not happenThat Padson died when he died"" lei, your majesty said, you do not be confused ah"Merritt said quickly"Shut up!" lei threw a waveLEI's right hand fingers, like steel claws, directly caught Merritt's throat, and immediately put Merritt on the suspension."Ah, ah, ah!" Merritt looked at lei in horror, praying for lei"LeiClyde immediately soundedLei is sneering fingers hard, the last hand a loose“Bang!” and Melite’s whole person fell to the ground. He kept licking his throat, making it hard, ah, ah. When he was dying, he couldn’t believe it... He’s talking today. When Clyde is here with me, it will be such an endingAt the moment of dying, Merritt also recalled the scenes of his life. He thought most of them were still women."If you know you're going to be killed by lei, you shouldn't let that Alice off that day."At the last moment, Merritt thought it was thisLei sneer at clyde"LEI, why do you want to start with me? I seem to treat you not thin"Clyde looked at the lei, but this time Clyde was looking forward to:" Snow lions, bring peopleFast, fast! ! ! "Clyde is a nine-class player and he is also a World of Warcraft player."Snow lions are originated from the Northern Territory’s eighth-ranked Ice-Cold Snow Lion, which is usually the residence of the Royal Palace.Because of the relationship between the soul contract, snow lion and Clyde are connectedWhen Clyde was in danger, Snow Lion had already knownClyde himself is very clear that what he has to do now is to ... delay the time and try to delay the time! "Yes, you are not me to be thin! However, my mother?" lei was staring at ClydeIf it wasn’t for Clyde’s original sentinel who took away his mother, his father might be alive, and his mother should stay at home.Your parents should be still alive! But because of Clyde’s original behavior, he had no parents"Mother, isn't it difficult for your mother to die?" said Clyde."Difficult to produce?" lei haha ​​laughed, laughing wildly, and then looked down at Clyde, "it's just a covert lieClyde, when my mother gave birth to my brother, my mother and father both went to pray for the blessing in the Temple of Brightness, but on the night of returning to the hotel, they were captured."" Clyde, do you forget, twelve years ago, did you let Paderson send people to take away my mother's thing? "LEI looked down at Clyde," Do not deny, Padson has explained everything""Well, that's your mother? Clyde completely choked"How, think of it?" lei thundered in the eyes, "say, how is my mother now? Tell me if she is alive or dead?" Clyde said indifferently: "your mother, I handed over to another peopleOne person you can't touch, and one person I can't touch."" Another person? Lei completely did not understandAt the same time, lei's heart also raised a glimmer of hope that even a character that Clyde couldn't get ridiculed would take away his mother.I am afraid there is an important reason, perhaps... My mother is still aliveClyde sneered and said, "But, I can tell you that your mother is dead and you must die.""Do notLei blinked"You don't believe it?" Clyde got to this one and laughed.
