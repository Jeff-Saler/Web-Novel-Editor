At the end of this inconsistent twisting road, the speed of the hundreds of people’s teams is not that fast. The mercenary guards in the entire team have carefully watched the direction of the World of Warcraft.There are two dangers to take this route. The first is Warcraft in the Warcraft Mountains and the second is the Robbers.Because this section is hundreds of miles long, neither belongs to the sacred alliance nor is it controlled by the Empire of O'Brien.There will naturally be many robbers"Hey, hey ~ ~" This flat-bottomed carriage made a rhythmic sound, and lei was contented to drink this crude wine."No drinking for three years. This coarse wine will taste better than the fine wine of Clearwater Paradise.Lei sighed with a smile, the next babe is eager to eat barbecueThe two old mercenaries with the same flat-drawn wagon and lei said: “Brother, my name is Lands, this is my little brother named Luther.Lei slightly surprised, lei understand the other is the name you want to knowCan Lin Lei knows that he is ranked in the Red List of the Inquisition of the Holy See."You can call me lei.Lei said with a smile"Rego, what level of Warcraft is your leopard?"The young guy named Luther immediately enthused and asked," This Warcraft's fur is really smooth, riding such a World of Warcraft can really have a face, ah, I think this Warcraft, at least seven World of Warcraft It""You only need to know that advanced Warcraft is on the lineLei said at randomBut he was still running wildly next to the dark-haired clouded leopard ‘Black Lu’ and his cold eyes were on Luther’s eyes. Luther was shocked by Hei Lu’s eyes and smiled.People in the Magnolia mainland know that the wisdom of Warcraft is not lower than human beings. They must not treat them as domestic animals.Otherwise, the consequences may be very heavy"You two are sacred alliances, or O'Brien empire?" lei inquiredFor the O'Brien empire, lei knew very little"We are all from the Empire of O'BrienLangz laughed"Reggio, what about you?" "This is the first time I've been to the O'Brien empire. I've heard this O'Brien empire was extremely martial, but it has no real insight.Lei said flatlyWhether it is Langz or Luther, they are living on the knife edge.Their eyesight can all be very accurate. At a glance, lei is the kind of strong personage.After all, if you want to rein in a terrible World of Warcraft, you must completely defeat him in strength to make it surrender.RegoThe people of our O'Brien Empire are all very respectful of the strongWherever you are strong, you will be treated politely."Lands laughed and said," Rego you for the first time to the empire, is familiar with the empire? ""In addition to knowing that the empire is divided into seven major provinces, knowing martial arts, the others are unclear.Lei laughedThe O'Brien empire is the most powerful military power in the entire Magnolia continent. The territorial scope should also be the largest of the six major forces.In the seven provinces, the area of ​​any province must be larger than that of a kingdom."Rego, I told youOur empire, the master of the capital, is the largestThat is, the 9th-class strongman did not dare to run in the Royal Park.After all, Vulcan Gate is located on a mountain in the outskirts of Royal Park.Langz said warmly"Wu Shen Men?" lei is not clear about thisThe Luther next to him quickly said: “Rego, you must know that the highest ritual site for O'Brien’s empire is the 'Vulgate Gate'.The Valkyrie was generally a hundred years old, and it took hundreds of years to receive a pro-disciple.The number of his disciples is extremely rareHowever, if you can be accepted as a disciple by the goddess, the Ten Commandments can become the sanctuary.Lei really shockedOriginally he thought that O'Brien College should be the highest school, and now it sounds far worse than this 'Vulgate Gate'.“But it’s really hard to get the god of war to be a disciple.It is a notorious disciple. The martial arts master also receives one or two years.Langz sighedOnly one or two years to collect one, still just a discipleThis probability is even higher than the elimination rate of Ernst Magic School.But think about it and understandAfter all, it is to worship God as a teacherThe Valkyrie... it was beyond the existence of the sanctuary five thousand years ago."So, Rego, you have to be careful when you come across the martial arts gate.They are killing people, and generally no one dares to controlLangzLei understandThe Valkyrie O'Brien was the founding emperor of the O'Brien Empire. Although he had already withdrawn his position, his influence was even higher than that of the Emperor.The Valkyrie O'Brien is the pillar of the Empire"correctDo you know what geniuses are appearing in the capital? Lei suddenly askedIn lei wanted to come: "Wharton his dragon Blood Warrior blood concentration is higher than me, the potential should be stronger than meNow Wharton is also seventeen years old.There should also be a great reputation at O'Brien College."According to the Dragon Blood Warrior cultivation speedIn the past decades, the sanctuary can be attained. Therefore, after 20 years of hardships, you can reach the 9th level warrior and reach the 8th level in more than 10 years.With Wharton's talent, you can definitely rejuvenate the capital"Genius? Are you talking about the genius Juggernaut' Olivia?" said Lands."The genius Juggernaut 'Olivia'?" The name, lei heard nothing heard, "This Olivia on what basis is called a genius Juggernaut?" Luther said quickly next to: "Rego, In the empire, if you don’t know even the genius Juggernaut, you will be laughable.Do you know when the Olivia adults reached the sanctuary realm, how old is it? "The sanctuary? <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "How big is it? " lei's heart is calmDragon Blood Warrior FamilyIn a few decades, it can reach the sanctuary boundary.In general, the so-called geniuses have to spend nearly 100 years."Years old!" Luther said. "Olivia, when he was 30, he was a strongman and he was 47 and he entered the sanctuary realm.That is, three years ago, in the year of the Holy Alliance and the Alliance of Lights' Day of Destruction, the Olivia adults stepped into the sanctuary.Lei nodded slightlyIt seems that the day of disaster was called the day of destruction."No wonder I don't knowLei understandWhen the other person's reputation became a big shock, he entered the Warcraft Mountains and spent a full three yearsNalud clearly admired the genius Juggernaut ‘Olivia’Even said: "Rego, I told youAfter the Olivia adults reached the 9th level, the warriors had voluntarily tried to take him as their son.But Olivia adults refusedOlivia adults want to walk their own path to cultivation"LEI also did not admire this Olivia heart, a martial arts beyond the sanctuary initiative to accept him as a disciple, could even refuseIt really is a lot of confidence to do this"This is the first time in history that it refused to marry"Luther's Worship Road“Rego, many people thought that Olivia was the limelight, insulting Olivieria.However, it is true that the Olivia adults did not brag. Three years ago, after Olivia stepped into the sanctuary realm, he directly challenged the Sky Juggernaut' Tyrone.""Tillon? Lei brow creaseLei remembered very clearly that in the town of wushan two strong sacred battles between the two, one is the sky Juggernaut tyron, one is the holy magician RudyThe two names of lei can not be forgotten"CorrectLord Tyrone, an expert in the sky and swordsman Tilong, has been famous for a long time, and he has been in the sanctuary for almost a hundred years.Olivia stepped into the sanctuary and challenged Tyrone directly. Many people think that Olivier Asia Pacific has been arrogant.But the day of the decisive battle...” Luther’s eyes were full of worship. “Only three swords, the Star Swordsman 'Tillon' was defeated.Into the sanctuary defeated the Star Swordsman 'Tyron'This shocked everyone, and it was only because of Olivia’s strength and genius that it was recognized." lei is also admiredIn the past, he often talked about some of the strongmen with Grandpa Delin, and lei knew it well...into the sanctuary.In the middle of the sanctuary and the strongest sanctuary, the difference is very large.Titanium has entered the sanctuary for a hundred years, but only three swords have been defeated by Olivia who has entered the sanctuary.LEI had to admit that Olivier Asia Pacific is strongerEspecially when the other person was only 47 years old.When the age of 47 reached the sanctuary, it was still so strong.Is the ultimate warrior, not much better than it******* chat with these mercenaries walking all day longLei also knows a lot about the O'Brien Empire and has a spectrum of heartsWhen it was dark, the team stopped again to prepare for the overnightA bonfire ignited everywhere, and various kinds of game were taken out. LEI also accompanied a group of bonfires with Luther and Lenz. The bonfire was grilled with thigh meat.Lei suddenly turned and looked in the direction of the black-rugged clouded leopard. I saw a noble boy in a gentleman's clothing standing beside the black-printed clouded leopard, excitedly watching ‘black Lu’."So beautiful leopard"The noble boy's sparkling eyes stared at the black-rugged clouded leopard. He even reached out slowly and he touched Black Lu.Black Luke is the top nine of WarcraftVery proudCan you touch an ordinary human? Black Lu suddenly turned his head, and the cold sister-in-law looked at the aristocratic youth and protested with a low voice: "Oh ~~" "Oh"The aristocrat juvenile was scared backwards and he fell directly to the ground and was scared and frightened.“Haha"Lands, Luther, and lei all laughed.At this moment, the door of the carriage was not far away, and a woman wearing a lilac noble dress immediately jumped out of the carriage in panic: “Kehn, Keane, what's wrong with you?” Seeing this woman, lei could not help her eyes open.That dress is tightly tied around the waistShows the savage waist, and the tight waist makes the chest more bulgingRunning, long hair flutteringThe graceful figure is also among the top three among the women that LEI has seen.Look at her appearance should look like 17 eight years old"Sister, sister"The noble boy clings to this woman with some panicThe black-printed clouded leopard ‘Black Lu’ was also dissatisfied with the aristocratic youth at this time, but it was the aristocrat woman who also scared her face and turned white."Don't be afraid, Black Lu will not hurt youLei said with a smile“Haha, Miss Janey, you have to take good care of your younger brother. This powerful World of Warcraft is not a pet of your family. You may be annoyed that you have eaten him, haha...” said Ronz, smiling.This was a whisper that Miss Gianni and her aristocrat were all white.Then Jenny pulled up the nobleman and stood up, and then Janeny bowed an apology with some restraint: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" Don't say sorry to us, this World of Warcraft is Rego'sSay it on the line with Rego"Luther also joined in the excitementGianni looked up at LEI. Obviously, this Jenny is not good at personal conversation, but with the eyes of lei, even the face is even redder: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."It's okay. Afterwards, let your younger brother don't try to mess with Heilu."Lei said with a smileI haven't seen girls who are so easy to be shy for a long timeJenny immediately dragged the noble boy to the distance and drove in the carriage."Interesting, interestingLei smiled and raised the wine sip with a drink
