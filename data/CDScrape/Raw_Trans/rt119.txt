The more wind power magic went up, the more terrible the power became.In particular, the single attack magic can even be said to be the first in each department.Such as taboo magic ‘dimensional blade’, like nine magic ‘vacuum lore’"LEI, so, when we return to the city of Finlay, I will immediately send someone to tell Clyde.Clyde will directly honor you in the near future and give it to you.Gilmer said with a smileLei nodded"Lei“Lampson next to him patted lei's shoulders in a friendly manner. “There are some things on the officialdom that you don’t need to worry about. What you need to do is to practice quietly. I really want to see that in fifty years we have the Holy See. More sacred strongmen come"Fifty years? lei confident in the hearts of fifty years, to become sanctuary Dragon Blood WarriorAs for the Sacred Mages in fifty years, it will be too difficult."try hard"Gilmer also patted shoulders with enthusiasm... A luxury carriage wanders on a country road, next to the meditative trees that quickly retreat toward the rearThere are rows of valiant knights in front of and behind the carriageThis luxury team arrived at the city of Finlay at noon.City of Finlay, in the living room of the Debus family"Alice, can you forgive me?" Kaplan held Alice's hand and stared at Alice.Alice with a hint of helplessnessGently noddedWhat can she do? "Lorraine, she's coming soon.Alice whispered. "I'll go back first.""Anyway, Alice and Karan are still not husbands and wives, even if they are not marriedOnly after the big wedding, the second person can be considered a real couple.Before the wedding, Alice needed to avoid theEvery day is back home"Lorraine?" Card Blue couldn't help but hear the nameRowling, who is the best wife of him KalanBecause the reputation of the stone ‘waking up’ has also made the woman engraved by ‘Wake up’ deep into many people’s hearts.Once Karan is engaged, I am afraid that many people will recognize Alice.In a short period of time, the Debuss family has selected a right wife for Karan."Card blue"A cheerful voice soundedI saw a blond girl who had grown up happily ran overThe girl looks very pure and has the aristocratic atmosphereEspecially that big eyes are cuteRowlingYou came"Karan tried to squeeze a smileKaran must also admit that Rowling is a very cute girlWith RowlingI'm afraid no one will refuseIt was only Alice’s true love in his heart.“Uncle Bernard isRowling's big eyes kept looking around"Father, he went out to work. It is estimated that he will return later.Kalan repliedKaran knows exactly what his father is doing because the Dawson Chamber of Commerce’s suppression has caused the various businesses of the Debus Group in the kingdom of Finlay to almost collapse into a crash. Every day, they lose money and lose money. It is a year and a half. FortunatelyBut if it's a long timeThe family is no longer tolerableMoreover, the family cannot sit on the mountainAfter all, other families in the kingdom of Finlay are also eyeingSo... His father Bernard made a very threatening decisionSmuggle water jade mineShuiyu, a precious spar, is generally used to inlay on magic wands.For water magician is very goodAnd Shui YuIn the kingdom of Finlay, there are many reservesThe Kingdom of Finlay also earned a staggering wealth from Shuiyu.Because Shuiyudi is precious, it naturally causes many people to start smuggling in Shuiyudi.However, the smuggling of the Shuiyu Mine was disgusted by the King’s impregnation by Clyde. For grabbing the smuggler, Clyde was directly executed.However, because the profits of the smuggling Shuiyu mine are too large, there are five or six times the profits, so the profits of the land are enough to make these businessmen take risks.In the past, the Debus family did not need to take the risk, but now it is impossible toThe legitimate business road is completely sealed off by the Dawson Chamber of Commerce. The Debus family can only choose to smuggle! "It shouldn't be wrong"Karlan secretly said, "Father and his partner of choice, but now the kingdom's finance minister, his paternal younger brother PadsonIn cooperation with him, the possibility of problems should be very lowPadson, the finance minister of the Kingdom of FinlayAs the finance of managing a kingdom, Clyde naturally wants his latest person to serve as the position of Minister of Finance."Uncle Bernard is backRowling's crisp soundKalan also looked upWhen I saw Bernard, he smiled and walked in from the door. He saw Rowling smile and said: "Roreen, have you come? Have you had dinner?" "Not yetRowling repliedBernard nodded. "I'll have dinner with your Karan brother tonight, um, I'll talk to you and Karan, and you're going to chat with Alice first.Wait a moment to let you card blue brother to accompany youBernard said, he made a look at Karan.Kalan happened to follow Bernard and the two entered the secret chamber.Closed Shimen, lit candles"Father, how is it?" Karan hurriedly askedBernard had a grin on his face: "I have consulted closely with Prince Padson and he has promised us.However, in this business, profit is divided into five parts."" Five five divided? "Karan blinked. "Father, the Duke of Padson has too much appetite. Smuggling Shuiyu ore is a matter of money. Our funds are from our family. Even horses are ours.He just arranged some channels to arrange smuggling safety lines."<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> Card Blue does not understand the importance of the channelBut the Debuss family spent too much money, and Padson didn't spend a gold coin. He just used it to shut down and got a huge fortune."The five or five divisions are still acceptableBernard said with a chuckle. "This Duke of Padson does not just arrange channels. The most important thing is that he did this by betraying the kingdom of Finlay and betraying his brother."If Clyde knew that Padson was his younger brother, I'm afraid that Clyde would not be soft."Card blue nodded slightlyOne Duke of the otherIt is also the Minister of Finance.Taking such a big risk in arranging channels and earning half of the profits can also be understood... Bernard and Carran walked out of the chamberBack to the living roomAnd now Rowling is talking to Alice."Yes, KalanI just learned from Padson that in the next three days, His Majesty the King will personally award the sensation to the lei in the palace.Bernard told us, "You gave me a gift, and I would give it to lei a few days later.""Card Blue noddedAlice, who was not far from talking to Rowlin, could not help looking at it here."Lee's brother, to be sealed?" Alice whispered in his heart.In the Grand Palace of the City of FenlayDozens of noble ministers stood in an orderly manner under the main hall, and Clyde was high above.Looking down at the crowd"YouToday I have a big event to announceClyde smiled brilliantly and repliedSome ministers who have already received information in the dark know what Clyde is going to say.Clyde looked at the waiter beside himThe court waiter immediately shouted: "Passed by Lin Lei and Baruch, entered the hall."The sound spread out, after a while - dressed in a black and gold-clad robe of wizards ram strolled into the hallAll noble ministers in the entire hall turned their eyes to lei"See you under the armLei respectfullyClyde looked at lei, his face as if laughingly opened a flower: "lei, you can serve the kingdom, I am very pleasedI will now seal you as the first court magician in the kingdom of Finlay and give you the title of Marquis"" You can have opinions? Clyde glanced beneathThe nobles of the lower ranks looked enviously at lei, but none of them disputed it."Chen, Xie Xiaxia" lei instantly covered in graceIn fact, in accordance with Archbishop Gilmer's words, the Holy See can make lei a duke.Only lei thinks this is too shockingAfter all, I haven’t been there at all.It's not easy to improve too much at onceSo take a step back and be the Marquis first"Lee, you are the first court magician and MarquisNature can no longer live in the Dawson Chamber of Commerce.I have arranged a very quiet house for youRight on the green leaf road not far from the palaceClyde said with a smileLei immediately thanks againActually, regarding the title of the title and residence, Clyde had already talked with Lin Lei last night. Today, it is only publicly announced in the main hall of the palace.When leaving the hall, lei also talked to these ministers.The highest level of the Kingdom of Finlay, mainly the chief of the army, the right-phase, the left-phase, the minister of finance, the minister of supervision, etc.These people are almost in charge of all sorts of things within the entire kingdom of Finlay.Most of these people are princes, the lowest one is also the MarquisGreen leaves on the roadLei sits in the carriage and retires with her eyes closed"lei adults, comeThe voice of the servant from outside the carriageLei opened his eyes and then opened the door and drove down the carriageAnd Bebe jumped directly over the shoulder of the lei from the carriage."Wow, it's so big."Bebe eyes stare at this houseLei also carefully looked at the mansion given by the king's majesty. This mansion is indeed an extremely large area. The gate is only ten meters wide. Through the open door lei, many mentors and maids can be seen inside. Many knights from the temple"Not badLei nodded into it"grown up"The waiter at the door watched his respectfully, and suddenly the maids and servants in the front yard of the mansion all stopped in uniform and saluted lei."For the first time, we must make a good impression on the owner. The servants here all know that their master has a good place."Master lei, congratulations, congratulations!"Suddenly there came a familiar voiceLei turned around and looked: "Mr. Bernard"They are the chiefs of the Debusian family, Bernard. Bernard smiles and sees lei:" Master lei, it's a coincidence that my family's residence is on the greenery, but it's just a family behind you.Afterwards, it is much simpler""OhLei also remember that when he first rescued Alice, Ka Lan and others, when they arrived at Ka Lan's home, the Ka Lan family seemed to be not far away."However, lord lei, your house is much larger than my family's house.Your house was in the past but it was yoursBernard complimentedLei also feel that this mansion is amazing, much bigger than his ancestral homeTo have such a large site in the city of Finland, which is very expensive, it is not simply possible to have money.It was no wonder that here was where Clyde had lived."Mr. Bernard, I'll go back first, and I'll have time to talk about it later.Lei humbly laughed, then turned around into the mansionAnd this time at the door of the Debus family, Karan, Rowlin, and Alice were standing together and looking at it.
