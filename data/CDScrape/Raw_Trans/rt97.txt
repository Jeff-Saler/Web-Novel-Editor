Ray was shocked by the words of Derlin Korth.“Grandpa Delin is the holy maestro of the era of the Pu'ang Empire. Even he has not seen such a complicated magical array. He also determined that this magical array is more terrifying than the taboo magical power.That..." lei felt a hint of jealousyWhat is this mysterious magic array here? "LEI, you feel it, feel the magic array, and the long purple sword"Drincowwater said to leiLei nodded slightly, the mood immediately integrated with the elements of the wind, feel the mysterious magic array and the purple sword that handleClosed his eyes, lei felt that the mysterious black magic round array has a heavy sense, so lei feel suffocatingAt the same time, the entire black circle, or the entire magic array, constantly sends out a universe of stocks."No wonder the density of the elements here, nearly as much as the outside worldThe original source is it"If it is not clear that this round of Taiwan magic array, lei can not find this sourceBecause the element at the source is continuously accumulatingIn fact, the density of the elements in the cave is the strongest"Here the seven elements of fire, wind, darkness, light, and thunder and lightning are the strongest elements of darkness.No wonder that both the Dark Ward and the Dark Warrior are particularly fond of here."lei secretly nod"The purple swordLei carefully felt the long sword with the center position of the black round table magic, "good restrained darkness"Dring Corvette asked to smile and looked at the lei:" lei, I can tell you that the preciousness of this purple long sword should not be under the sacred nucleusLei puzzled look to delincowaterLei is very clearThe weapon of the average soldier is not too valuable, as long as some hard metal ore is used, and some other ores can be forged.This is the Baruch's family's heritage sword and ‘sculptor’, and the original cost was tens of thousands of gold coins.Later, an heir of the Baruch family sold the sword ‘Mu Tu’ to 180,000 gold coins.Which also accounted for the light of a little dragon warriorUnfortunately, the Dragon Blood Warrior has not appeared for many years. The ‘Dragon Warrior’ gimmick is not worth enough.If the Dragon Blood Warrior is facing the mainland, the value of this sword may be very high.Warrior's weapons are worthless, but the Wizard's StaffThe price is horribleThe more advanced the staff, the more precious the materialFor example, an artifact used by the Sanctuary Magister uses special wood to manipulate the rod, using nine-level magic nucleus or sacred magic crystal nucleus as the energy source, and then assisting in the complex magical sculpture to achieve Best effectA magic wand that can be called an 'artifact' is absolutely priceless.After all, the Sanyo Magic Crystal Core is priceless.Of course, the weapons of the soldiers are not worth the money, but what is said is that the soldiers of the Magnolia mainland are material planes. If a weapon is derived from other planes,For example, it comes from the four to the highest planeThe price can be different“The purple sword has a very strange atmosphere. If I guess it is good, it should come from the ‘Hell’ in the four highest planes."Delin Kewot Shen Shen saidLei puzzled: "Four to the highest plane?" Deling Ke Watert's white beard tilted Alice said: "Looking at the entire Magnolia continent, your strength is now considered barely into the top of the entire continent.Something should tell you tooLei, you should know that this world is not just a planeLei nodded: "I know, for example, there are underworld""You know very little"Derlin Corvette shook his head and said," Actually, there are numerous spatial planes in Haoyu, and material planes can only be regarded as ordinary planes that are very basic.Among the numerous planes, there are four major planesThey are - Underworld, Hell, Lifeworld, Heaven"Delin Kewot said in detailLei listened carefully, these messages may be in the magnolia mainlandOnly the top strong will know"LEI, you should know, what is God?"Drinkovt smiled and looked at leiLei nodded: "Go beyond the sanctuary, call God“ lei read a lot of books, the general book describes the power beyond the sanctuary, are the power of GodThat is a powerful irresistible force"CorrectAbove GodThere is also the Lord God, but above the Lord GodThere are four most high gods! "Drinkingwater sighed." These four supreme gods are eternal beings that are beyond all beings."For the first time, lei heard about the existence of the 'four great gods'"The supreme god is more powerful than the light?" lei asked“Haha, the light ruled?” Dring Corvette grinned. “Whether it is the “Glory of the Light” or the “dark ruler” of the Holy See, it is only the Lord God.The Lord God is very powerful to us for God in general.But they still need the power of faith"And unlike the Most High God, the Four Most High Gods do not need believers at all and do not need the power of faith."Their strength is destructiveThe Lord of Light, the Lord of Darkness, I am afraid that this Lord God can only serve as the servant of the Most High God. This depends on whether God is supreme or not."Drincowwater affirmedLei surprised in mind"Underworld, hell, life gods, and heavens, these four highest planes are created by the four greatest gods.In the past, I used to feel the breath of the four highest planes, so as soon as I saw the purple sword, I decided that it should come from ‘hell’."Derlin Kewot immediately looked at the long purple sword that was inserted in the center of the black circular table." I also have some doubts. How did the hell plane surface come to this? "<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "LEI, think about it, this magic array is more powerful than taboo magic. The purple sword is used to assist it." At the energy level, at least with this magic, I suggest that you ... ... drop blood to try to see if you can take this excalibur"Drinkovt eyes beamed"Receive?" lei heart also some want to get this treasure"Don't be afraid, no matter what this mysterious magic array is doing, such a giant magic array will start.It takes a long timeThis is enough for you to run very far, you first drop blood to see if this sword has a master, if you do not have the master you took, absolutely nothingNo one feels"Drincowwater affirmedAn excalibur that can be used for ‘spitting blood’ is no longer a product.Bring on the body, others cannot notice it at allIt seems to others that it is just as common as the Ring of Dragons."it is good”Lee blood grudges” lining inside the body, suddenly the upper body, arm scales began to disappearDragon Blood Warrior's Second Form 'Half Dragon'Lei can completely control the body part of the dragonIn other places and normal humans, after the index finger bites, the lei jumps up directly, and the index finger of the blood directly points to the purple long sword that does not know how many years existed.The handle was covered with dust. I didn't know how long the purple long sword was. After the drop of dripping blood on the lei, the purple sword looked like a sponge. It was easy to swallow this drop of blood. "The purple sword suddenly made a squeak and began to tremble.The dust that was smeared on its surface was completely shaken off.The entire surface of the Purple Sword faintly flows from the blood of a monster. It seems that blood flows on the sword."The Lordless"Seeing this scene, Derinkhoff was pleasantly surprisedDerlin Kewater knew very well that if this excalibur had its owner, then lei had no hope at all.If this tactical sword did not have a master, then lei had a great deal of stumbling."lei, quick, unplug this sword and immediately leave me here"Derlin Corvette urged the road"knowLei jumped once again and grabbed the purple long sword directlyThen suddenly pull"Yeah!" The sound of a crisp sword sang and seemed to have endless joy. Lin Lei was absorbed by the purple sword after just one drop of blood.Lei knowsThis long violet sword is a soft sword! Only need to pour grudges or magic power, or other forces are enough to make the sword straightCan be soft and hard! Lei pull out this purple long sword, in the process of landing a purple sword, purple long sword immediately around the lei's waist wrapped in a circle, like a belt“Bebego"LEI Lei single-handedly picked up his parcelAnd then the whole person rushed past the direct passageway.The scales of the whole body are constantly coveredBebe also suddenly hit the shoulders of leiFully-to-earth lei, with early-eighth attackAnd in terms of speed, it's catching up to the dexterity of the 8th level warrior."Seven levels of 'acceleration'Lei at the same time display auxiliary magic ‘acceleration’Seven levels of ‘acceleration’ can increase the speed of the four-level warriors by three timesHowever, for today's lei, he is now too fast. Even if there is ‘acceleration’ assistance, it will increase speed by nearly half.But if you can raise it by half, you are already horrible.****** The fog above the misty valley was lingering, and the dragons that had circled above and flirting above, except for a few, fell to the ground and rested on the ground.However, they are all away from the hill without exceptionThe passage that the hill held down, it was forbidden! The dragons also remember that the poor human beings rushed into the forbidden land a few days ago.Presumably the poor human has been killed."Call!" A black phantom slammed out of underground tunnels and then rushed directly westwards."What is that?" over a hundred dragons have noticed this human phantomThe speed of the eight-level sensitive warrior is absolutely catching up with the speed of the eight-level dragon flight. Now, lei uses ‘top speed’ to increase the speed by half.Now the speed of lei is definitely the speed of the 9th fighterNot much worse than ‘bebe’"Hey ~ ~" over a hundred dragons slammed down in anger at onceThere was even a human being who came to the site of the dragon race. A dragon had started flesh wings to chase the lei. However, now the speed of the lei is too fast. It is the largest dragon that can only watch the lei The farther away, they will get rid of them for a while and disappear within sight."It's not like humans"The largest dragon hovered in volley, but he was puzzled.Although it did not catch the other side, but it has just seen it, the other person is a humanoid, but has a scale monster"Humanoid World of Warcraft?" This fire dragon heart tunnel... underground caves, that black round stage, the mysterious magic array of magical lines to the extreme point of the magic began to gradually light up, as if a bright silver water flows through every trace of the magic array, gradually ... ... The whole mystical magic array is bright and bright."Boom!" A low-pitched roar sounded, and the mysterious magical light became even more dazzling, only to hear the roar more and more, more and more anxious. "Boom!" "Boom!" "Boom!" "Boom!"... The sound of the waves sounded like a drum, and the mysterious magic array continued to shudder."Hey--" The dark circular table that did not know the material suddenly cracked open, with three cracks
