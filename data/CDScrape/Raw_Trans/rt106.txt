In the Kass family's living room, candlelight shines, the beautiful maid brings a dish, a group of people push cups, talks enthusiasm and politeness.Lei has also received aristocratic education since childhood, and for these still know, on the surface with a nobleman to talk politely, but lei is still more tired of this"Duke Bernard, you are freeLei greeted the Duke of Bernard and walked away. lei walked directly towards the prince of the loukas family, the prince of Jeb, and the marquis of jebu met lei and came to understand that the battle of knives was a matter of mourning. Can't escapeLin Lei and Marquis Jeb also went to the seat on the side of the living room"Marquis de Jeb, I have come to believe that your nephew has told you” said lei humblyThe Marquis of Jeb sighed in a low voice: "I'm an old guy, lei, I really don't want this collection.“The Marquis de Jeb, I have more than 5,000 years of history in the Baruch family. I have always been proud that I am the child of the Baruch family. However, the family inherited to this day, and the “Tourman” sword of the inheritance was lost. TheI can tell you definitively that you, Marquis de Jeb, that our family has been working hard in order to use the sword to kill the sculptor, and I have been practicing it since I was young, and today, a large part of this is because of the family's heritage." Although lei's voice is very calm, but the words contained in the words 'must get' but it is obvious"I understand, I understandThe Marquis of Jeb worked hard to squeeze a smileThe inheritance of the other family, of course, want to get backThe Marquis of Jeb also understood that if he did not surrender his sword, he would provoke the 17-year-old young man.The Marquis of Jeb was very aware of this young man’s ‘affecting’Not to mention the Holy See, the Dawson Chamber of Commerce, which can easily take their Lucas family."LeiThe sword ‘slaughter’ is a very valuable collection. It was once offered me a million gold coins and I’m not willing to sell it.“Jebb Marquis’s topic went to ‘money.” “Our Lucas family is old, but honestly, wealth is not much.Lei is also very clear on this point, according to the yalu check out, the lucas family is very old, very powerful in the Kingdom of FinlandHowever, the wealth is far less than that of the Debus familyLet a family that is not too wealthy give away a treasure worth millions of coins at onceThis is a bit unrealistic"For money?" lei heart breathIf you want money, it's not hard."Marquis de JabAt the beginning, you also spent money to buy the ‘Tuo’ war knife.And now, naturally, I will pay the number that will satisfy youOf course, I also hope that the Marquis of Jeb does not want the lion to open his mouth, ohLei said with a smileThe face of Marquis Gerber smiledThe sword ‘killing’ must be given to the other party, but at the very least some gold coins must be returned."LEI, you treat my Lucas family so sincerely, my Lucas family also gives you faceThis sword ‘slaughter’ is worth millions of gold coinsAs long as you pay 600,000 gold coins, you can take away this sword and kill it.“Jewel Marquis said brisklySix hundred thousand gold coins? Compared with the value of the sword knife, it is indeed not expensive.However, nowadays, the income of lei's stone carvings totals only 20,000 gold coins.This time back from the mountains of Warcraft, it really carries a lot of magic crystal coreHowever, these magic crystal cores are estimated to have a value of more than 100,000 gold coins.Not enough to add upLei there are valuable things - blue heart grass and sanctuary purple bear black magic crystal core! Lanxincao, lei also has more than 100 strains, and each strain has tens of thousands of gold coinsThe Sacred World of Warcraft crystal core, let alone saySanctuary Warcraft crystal core is pricelessThe price is more expensive than the nine magic crystal corepastNine Magic Crystal Core Pricing is Five Million CoinsStill recorded in the bookIn fact, a good nine magic crystal core to nearly 10 million gold coins! As for the sacred magic crystal nucleus, I am afraid that the offer of 100 million gold coins can not be bought.Priceless treasure! Lei certainly will not come out of this sanctuary magic crystal coreThe blue heart grass is also very important for the Dragon Blood Warrior family. One of them will cherish a strain.'Wake up' stone carving! Lei suddenly thought of this in mind, for the ‘wake up’ stone carving, lei’s feelings are very complicated, even lei do not want to seeSo lei has kept this stone sculpture in Yale's custody."Sell it"lei suddenly made this decision in mind, even in lei heart also flashed a thought - "do not know Alice, she saw this stone will be what is the idea? Lei enquired about delincowater"LEI Lei, this ‘dream’ stone carving is also sold"Drincowate replied," You don't want to see this ‘dream awakening’ stone sculpture, but if you always take it with you, you’ll often think of it.Or sell it directlyAnd...it’s also known for the ‘general school’ I founded.Lei smiled“Marquis de Jabe, don’t worry, six hundred thousand coins will come soonI hope that during this period of time, you should not sell ‘Tu’s knife to others"Lin Lei said sincerelyThe Marquis of Jebour even promised: "You do not worry, if you are willing to bid two million coins, I will not sell it."If not for the identities of lei, Marquis de Jebus will be willing to sell it?****** Prouks Hall, in the office of Ao Tony Landi"What, are you willing to sell that stone?" Ostoni had a horror and ecstasy in his eyes.Lei nodded slightly, next to Yale but also looked at lei helplessYale and lei grew up from a young age, very clear on the character of lei, lei this person is extremely affectionate for others, very ambiguous, but also do not like to owe othersThis time, Yale is prepared to use lei hundreds of thousands of gold coins.According to lei's words: “this stone carving ‘wakes up’, I don’t want to see it anymore, or sell it well."Yaru also thought to myself that if the stone ‘dream awakening’ is sold, the reputation of lei will spread and lei’s status will rise.This is also a good thingSo <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> did not insist on lending gold coins"Okay, good"Ostoni excitedly said," lei you do not worry, you this stone, we will not charge a fee for a gold coin""I need to get the gold coin at the auction site within seven daysLei directly stated requirementsOstroni himself said: "You can rest assured that from tomorrow, we will arrange five-day exhibitions at the Prouks Hall and spread this ‘wake up’ stone carving message to every billionaire.On the seventh day, we will conduct a public auctionLei nodded"Yale bossLet's go"After officially handing the stone ‘Dream awake’ to the Prouks HallLei feel like there is something missing, but lei feels he is a little relaxed****** Prouks HallEarlier this morning, the Juno Earl will come to visit the Prouks Hall almost every morning to admire the works in the regular exhibition halls and then enjoy the works in the ‘Master Showroom’ and the 'Master Showroom’.But when Juno Earl entered the Hall, he discovered... "Hey, how many people gathered in the Master's Hall?" The Earl of Juneau was a little strange.There are always several exhibits in the master galleryLong timeNatural people are less likely to seeUnless there is a new master in a new workThe master show room will be a little lively“Is there a new masterpiece?” Earl of Juneau warmed up and immediately walked past the master showroom.It's only 8 o'clock in the morning. According to the truth, there are few people in the Prouks Hall, but there are already dozens of people gathered in the master hall.And these dozens of people are amazed at the exhibition in the center of the master gallery.Next to this exhibit, there are 18 powerful warriors protecting“What a strong attraction? Which masters and new works?” Count Earl of Juno squeezes to the front and looks carefullyThe Earl of Junot immediately lost his eyes and stared at the large stone sculpture in front of him.The Juno Earl seems to see five living peopleInviting, lovely, shy, charming, icyCount Junot immersed in that wonderful feeling for a whileHe wakes up“God works, master works!” Earl Juno immediately exclaimed in his heartTo appreciate the history of the Earl of Junot over a hundred yearsHe naturally felt the earthquake ravaged the soul, but when Count Junot carefully watched and tasted the work, Earl Juno lighted his eyes: "This carving style is not the one who Ernest Magic Academy's genius lei?" From the engraving style alone, the Earl of Juneau judged the engraving authorThe count of Juno is very familiar with lei, because the three pieces that lei first put in the plucks hall are what he bought.Later, Lin Lei’s work was placed in the ‘master’s showroom’ and a work worth nearly 6,000 gold coins.Ernst College magic genius, only seventeen years oldThe first transaction of Earl Juno made him earn more than 10,000 coinsNaturally, Juno Earl paid a lot of attention to this lei."Sure enough, heThe count of Juno looked at the lower left corner of the stone carving with the word 'Lei'.On the other side of the stone carving site, there is an introduction. The main thing is to introduce lei, “the writer of this stone carving, lei”, who is 17 years old and graduated from the Ernst Magic School, just 17 years old this year. Lei is already a seven-level double magician, he is now the absolute first magic genius on the magnolia continent, even in the magnolia mainland tens of thousands of years of history, lei is also the history of the second magic genius"However, lei has not only achieved such success in the magic field, but has achieved even greater achievements in the field of stone carving. After 17 years of age, this 'dream wake' stone carving has the spirit of the master's work, especially this work." Is a giant stone sculpture, the price is more inestimableIn addition, his work is a super magic genius who is only seventeen years old. The value of this ‘wake up’ stone sculpture can be imagined."We, the Prouks Hall, are honored to have been authorized by LEYEX. This work will be displayed for five days, and No. 421, that is, after the exhibition, we will conduct a public auction at the Prussian Pavilion.""The Earl of Juneau saw this introduction and understood it - "The Magnolias and the richest people in the Magnolia continent may have a heart"The Earl of Juno is also very clear that this work is definitely not something that people at this level can buy.""Seven-level double magician? Seventeen years old?" Seeing this introduction, Earl of Junot is also sighing in his heart.At the same time, Juno also became more admired for this ‘Lei’.One person can achieve such achievements in two fields at the same time. It is definitely worth admiring.“This stone carving should also catch the master’s work at the level of the work.Plus the huge volume...especially the stone carving author, or a mere seventeen years old, or the second magic genius in the history of the entire Magnolia continent.It seems that there will be a sky-high priceThe Earl of Junot already had the expectation"April 21st!" Earl of Juneau looked a bitAs time goes on, more and more people are in the ‘Master Showroom’. Many super-rich people who live in the Holy Capital quickly learned about this matter....Ostony’s office“Please, tell Your Majesty Wild. I really can’t be the master of this matter.If you really want to get this stone sculpture, please also buy it on the 21st."Astony sent a king's envoy to the kingdom."Waiting for the envoy to go, Ostoni's face sank down"Joke, just bidding for a million coins, you want to buy this stone sculpture directly. It's a dream. Yesterday's 'Clyde' of the Kingdom of Finlay sent someone to offer 3 million coins!" The exhibition has only been for three days. There are a dozen or so big people who want to buy this stone sculpture in advance."On the 21st, I'm afraid there will be a real sky-high price."Ostoni unconscious path
