A few months later, the orders of the Jakes family patriarchs were passed on: the location of the Lord of the city of Kirnwall County. During Keen's underagement, his sister Gianni assisted with the affairs of the county town.“Brother, are you leaving?” Gianni, Keane and Lambert all looked at lei in surprise.Keane inherited the position of the landlord, Jenny assistedToday's Jenny's sibling is the most relaxing moment. The siblings' two hearts are thinking of repaying Lin Lei. However, whoever wants lei to say that he wants to leave the shire county at this time.“Lee Brother"Jenny's eyes are even reddenedLei carrying the epee, standing on the shoulders of beibei, next to the black-printed clouded leopard ‘black lu’, lei laughed: “in the county town of shire, this complex environment, my cultivation has been affected by certainI didn't mean to go away, but I was quietly practicing for a while in the quiet valley outside of the county of Shre County."For leiThe most important thing is cultivation, especially in today's lei is still in progress, has not encountered a bottleneckAt this time, we should take the opportunity to work harderThe Dragon Blood Warriors in the Baruch family have been penanced for decades, waiting to reach the horizon of the Sanctuary.Master, must withstand loneliness"Valley?" Gianni and Keane breathed a sigh of relief"Well, there is time I may come to see you guysI can help you here tooIt will depend on you laterLei said with a smileSee Jenny, Keane this siblingLei sometimes think of themselves with a small wharton, and now they have no parents with small wharton"I don't know what Wharton is doing now, and when he realizes that the stance is above, he sets off to meet him."Lin Lei underground channelLei is very clearNow Wharton is studying at O'Brien College. At this time, he does not need to disturb him at all.And people only grow faster when they rely on themselves.Once I get to Wharton, I'm afraid it will hinder Wharton's growth.... The eastern part of the city of Chilcher has a blue mountain range, in a mountain valley in which there is no visible valley.Lei built a wooden hut here, and began a lonely cultivation hereAt night, there is a green lawn in the valley and a lake in front of the lawn.Lei sat cross-legged on the lawn next to the lakeshore, closed his eyes and quietly comprehend the nature, there is a campfire beside him burning, reflecting the lei's face is uncertainLei can feel the thickness of the earth, feel the wind flowing, feel the flow of waterFeel the fierceness of the fire... As a magician, in particular, the affinity of the wind system elements is super, etc., lei feels that the natural aspect has a great advantage over the average soldier.This is also the time in the Baruch family that the savage ancestor used to reach the sanctuary. It is only the reason why he achieves the status of "light weight". After all, the warrior is more difficult to integrate with nature than the magician.“The rushing ‘lightning’ of heavy lifting is like a volcanic eruption.And the so-called 'potential'It is the momentum of the world, but..." When meditation for a long time, lei suddenly understood"The potential, it is only potential, with the help of the power of the surrounding worldAnd all-inclusive ‘potential’What I am looking for now is the path that is most suitable"In the darkness, Lin Lei sat cross-legged on the shore of the lake and opened his eyes. The eyes are like sky stars."Different weaponsThe path is differentHeavy epee, strong potential Shen! While the epee has no front, naturally it does not rely on sharp wins.But relying on that great, bright, honest and unrivalled attackLei feels ambiguousThe practice of the black-to-heavy epee cultivation has similarities to the laws of the earth."The land is thick, the earth is boundless, the earth is steady..." lei held the black halberd epee, but the heart was completely in harmony with the pulse of the earth.The earth has its own unique pulsation. The kind of unique pulsating rhythm that quakes the soul generally senses that the earth has reached an extremely high level of awareness.Lei stood upThe whole man started waving the black epee quietly.With lei's black and ebony epee waving, lei from the pace of the entire people, whether from the action of the sword, have entered a unique rhythmIt's a heart-rending rhythm"call"Black pheasant epee seems to have millions of pounds of gravityPierce the air heavilyLei wields the black ebony epee, giving the feeling of being like a fusion with the earthEven if you look at his sword alone, you can feel a sense of heavyness."puff"Lei Lei to the black cymbals swiftly stabbed in the air, only to hear the sound of continuous blastsJust facing the space and stabbing, it even produced several explosive soundsThis is simply an incredible thing, because a weapon is faster and causes an explosive sound to be good.It is almost impossible to cause several explosions"en?" lei eyes suddenly brightCan be so distracted, lei immediately out of that wonderful feeling out of it“How was it? I didn’t use vindictiveness, but why could this force be divided into rhythmic attacks several times in a row?Lei heart ponderedWhen you are practicing, you may suddenly enter a special state at some point and achieve a very amazing effect.But if you don’t fully understand it, it’s impossible to pick it up.What lei has to do is to think constantly and continue to practiceEverything is perfectly mastered! ... The sky is blue, clear without any traces of impurities, and those few white clouds are like beautiful silk curtains floating in the sky. The valley in which LEI lives is indeed quiet.The wind blows, the lake movesLei did not cultivate at this time, but angling in front of the valleyPeople can't keep practising all the time. If it is always the same, the effect will be bad.Want to fish on fishing, want to sleep and sleepHeart is in harmony with the worldWhen practicing, efficiency will be extremely high“Lee Brother"The cheerful voice came out of the valley. lei turned around and saw Jenny riding a horse."Behind her there are two British heroes <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>. The two maids also clearly have good skills. Cavaliers with kinematic rules“JennyLei put down the fish, stand upAt this time, Beibei and Heilu are not in the same place. Both of them have entered the mountains to search for some beasts.The mountain where LEI is located is mostly an ordinary beast. As for Warcraft, it is extremely rare.“Lee Brother, this is some food I prepared for you."Jenny took a parcel from his horse and wrapped it tightly. "You are here, surely it's not good to eat it."Come on, Brother Lei, take a good taste“Jenny’s unveiled the layers, and it’s an iron box with various dishes and rice.”Lei smoked her nose"Well, it's really sweetLei said with a smileJenny's face immediately excited redLei heart is an annoyance, jenny's mind how can lei can not see it? Jenny, whether it is appearance or personality, is extremely talentedBut experienced so muchLei has been difficult to open the door to the depths of the soul"Feelings?" lei heart sighWhat kind of feelings do you want, or do you really want to cultivate?At this time, Lin Lei’s mind could not help but flash a scene - that is, after the death of lei's father, numerous nobles gathered in Wushan town. In the night, delia came to see lei late at night.Delia came to tell lei that she was going back to the magnolia empireAnd that night, Delia was saying goodbyeKissed lei"Delia?" In addition to Alice, lei may only have a little feeling of this girl from the Ernst Magic School met in the first grade, especially delia several sincerely confessionAlthough lei has not admitted it, but he must admit that the shadow of delia has been printed in his heart.“Lee Brother, eat it quickly."Jenny next to said expectantlyLei sighed at the bottom of my heart: "it can't seem to waste Janeni's youthLei thought about it and ate it too much. She also praised: "it's really good and it tastes good.""I heard lei's praise, jenny happily"Jenny, you don't need to come later.When I was practicing, I didn't like to be disturbed by others.Lei said to jennyA look at Gianni"OhJenny responded with a sigh and then smiled“Narray Brother has time to go to the castle""YepLei can only be heard... The days of cultivation are very fast, and in the near future lei stayed in the valley for nearly a month.For the understanding of the black phoenix epee, lei has gradually cleared the wayAs long as we stick to it and it is estimated that it will take several years, we can definitely reach a new level that exceeds 'potentiality'.****** In a quiet pub in the county of HearsThe light in the pub is dark and the main tone is dark, like duskAt the same time, the arrangement between the table and the dining table is also very regularAlso separated by screensVery quiet, very stylish, a pub, lei once liked to come hereThe consumption here is also relatively highIn addition to cultivation, after seven or eight days in general, lei will drink in this quiet pub and listen to the beautiful music in the pub.From time to time we can hear some of our guests talking"Fast July, Wharton should end this semester.Lei secretly thoughtAt this time there were still many guests in the tavern. The guests consciously used a slightly lower voice during the conversation. However, Lin Lei listened carefully and the conversations of every guest around could hear clearly.Suddenly a conversation caused lei's attention“Did you hear that a super talent appeared in the royal capital? The seventeen-year-old who was named 'Wharton'"There are three middle-aged people sitting on a table on the side of lei. They are talking about the genius of the empire."Wharton? Lei attention immediately concentratedSince entering the O'Brien Empire for so long, lei has really not heard anything about Wharton."What do you mean by the genius that came out of this year's O'Brien Academy grade competition?" the bald man next to his eyes brightened. "I've also heard that O'Brien's seventh grade is very much concerned. ofEven students who have reached Level 8 fighters participate in this gradeO'Brien College, as the first soldier school in Magnolia Mainland, added a seventh gradeReaching the 7th-level soldier can enter the 7th gradeSeventh-grade fighters can actually graduate, but many seventh-grade fighters still stay in college.Even the very few eighth-level fighters did not rush to graduate"Vulture, you know this news tooThat Wharton, really, oh"The middle-aged Peifa who spoke at the beginning sighed." At the age of seventeen, he has not participated in the grade competition in the past. This time he participated in the seventh grader and defeated the eighth-grade warrior.Becomes the 7th Grade Grade 1""what? Seventeen years old, also defeated eight soldiers? real or fake? The obese man who has been listening has shockedThe bald man blinked: "That is of course trueI watched it with my own eyes. You didn't know that Wharton was two-foot-tall and extremely strong. His stature alone gave him a terrible sense of oppression. His weapon was a giant horror sword.Holding the sword, Wharton defeated the eighth-level soldier.Become the first grade"According to others, this Wharton has now defeated the eight-level warrior, and it is estimated that he should be able to reach the eight-level warrior before the age of twenty."When the talented Juggernaut ‘Olivia’ reached the 9th level at the age of 30, this Wharton’s talent was not much worse than that."The blue hair man praised," Seventeen years old, defeated the eight-level warriorFor a long time, the Royal Capital did not have such a genius. It was even acknowledged as the first talent of O'Brien College. His Majesty the Emperor gave him his earlly title."(Two chapters are finished!
