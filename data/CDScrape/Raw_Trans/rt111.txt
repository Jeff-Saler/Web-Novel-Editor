Card Blue Brother"Alice whispered in a low voice, and at the same time anxiously watched that some people might be proud to become a prototype of a master stone carving."However, this work is different from lei, as long as some of the studies of stone carving, can be from five independent humanoid sculpture contained in the charm of the taste of the lei and alice pastIf Alice just became the wife of a small family, then it would beHowever, to marry her is the future successor of the Kalan & Debuses de Buss family. The Debus family is also the top three family in the Kingdom of Finland."Don't worry, don't worry"The blue card holds Alice's hand."But Alice felt that she was full of sweat."Father -" Karan looks to his father Bernard and looks to his mother againHis parents love him very much. This is why they are willing to give out 8 million coins for Karan. After all, for the Debus family, 8 million coins are a big figure."Ka Lan, don't think about it, the family couldn't bring out more than 10 million coins for you a fiancee.Bernard said with a serious faceKalan was stunned, and even Alice looked up at Bernard. There was something in her eyes that worried and a little expectation."According to our prior decision“Bernard ignored Alice’s expectations and declared it coldly.Kalan stayed for a long time and Alice next to him held Karan's hand tightly, staring at Kaylan's eyes.Alice understands what Bernard has just said and Alice is very reluctant to accept that result.Kalan looked at Alice and sighed helplessly and gently shook her head"Card blue brother, I don't wantAlice said in a low voiceCard Blue shakes Alice's handGently shook his head: "NotAlice, I'm the heir to the family. I have to think for the family. I also hope you can sacrifice a bit for me. I promise that I will not change your heart to earth.Alice is silentThe heir of the family! This simple word, but doomed Kalan everything to be closely linked with the family's honor and disgraceAlthough Bernard loves his son very much, he will not allow Alice to be the true wife of Karan anyway.Yes, I can't be a wifeIn other words, later Alice’s children will not be children.In fact, since the stone ‘dream’ was watched by many peopleThe Debuss family had asked Karan to give up Alice, even if she wanted to call Alice.It's impossible to let Alice be the true wife of KaranBut Karan has always insistedLater, after beating the blue card, Bernard compromised. He decided that if he could buy back the ‘wake up’, he would reluctantly accept it.But now it seems... "Card Blue Brother"Alice looks at Card Blue and her eyes are moist."At the same time, look to the surrounding Debus familyHowever, whether Karan, Bernard, or Karandi’s mother, they did not bother with Karan.At this moment, Alice felt a cold heart in her heartShe suddenly remembered when she was with lei, lei took care of her carelesslyIn the past, she thought that lei had moved her and cares for her as she should.But at this moment she is so eagerLooking up and looking through the glass to the third floor of the auction roomBut what she saw was only black glass."10 million gold coins, 10 million gold coins, is there any higher?" The blonde host yelled loudly on stage.A man dressed in a loose robe casually looks in every directionThen he shouted directly to the blonde host:You don't talk nonsense thereCount it down"The rich and nobles next to them all laughed.Whoever presides over the auction will listen to what the following people say? According to the rich nobles' understanding of this blond manHe will render the auction again and again, rendering the price of the work to an extremely high level.When the blonde host heard the voice, he felt like the whole person was being hypnotized. He naturally said, "I'll start counting down, three, two..." "10,100,000 gold coins!" Two floors spread outAll the people's eyes gathered in this box, and even the man in the loose robe was surprised to stare at this box.In this second-tier box, except for the Debuss family, the families in the other boxes are all large-scale families known throughout the Magnolia continent.The wealth of large families is much more than the Debuss family.“Oh, I’m really savvy, but I’ve added 100,000 coins, too much, 10.3 million coins."This man in a loose robe said with a smile.At the moment, in the third floor of the auction hall, lei and others noticed the man wearing loose robes.However, in this position they can only see the side of the man wearing a loose robe and cannot see the appearance of the robe man at all.“Grace?” The Gilmer Red Archbishop of the Holy See and the Red Archbishop of Lampson both stood up. They frowned and walked along the glass window to the other side, carefully looking at the man in the loose robe below.At this moment, the man in the loose robe seemed to find that the two red cardinals above looked at him and looked up at the two red cardinals.“Is he?” the two red cardinals face suddenlyGilmer and Lampson both looked at each other and both shook their headsIn fact, before the auction, the glorious church had a decision and decided that this time it would take a big price to auction the stone ‘dream’ to auction, so as to make lei more affiliated with the Holy See.However, Gilmer and Lampson both saw the man and changed his mind."Or don't fight with this madmanGilmer said quietlyLampson also nodded. "I don't want to mess with this madman."Although the other person is called 'the madman', but the fear is deep in their bones.For the horrors of the man in his 30s and 40s, Lampson and Gilmer are very clear.Especially Lampson...<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> because, because of this madman, I'm afraid that Lampson hasn't had a chance to upgrade.teachThere are only five positions in the Red Cardinal of the Holy See.It was precisely because the madman arbitrarily killed a red cardinal that gave Lampson a chance to sit in this position.But the Archbishop of Red was killed, and the Pope was not willing to be against this madman because of this."10.4 million gold coinsIn the second floor of the box, the man in the old gown who once again sounded a loose robe looked up and frowned. "You are still really troublesome, 11 million gold coins.""" 11 million gold coins, this gentleman bid 1100 gold coins, there is no higher"The blonde host is also excited. It needs to know that the top ten stone carvings are only about 13 million gold coins.On the third floor, Gilmer whispered to Lampson: "LampsonDo you know which family is in that box? Do you dare to fight this madman? Is it too long? ""The director of Maia"Lampson shouted to the director of Maia not far awayDirector Maia immediately came over“The director of MaiaDo you know which family is being quoted in the box? "Lampson inquired." It seems like the principal is a young girl."Lampson stood on the third floor, naturally seeing through the window the man on the sofa in the second floor.As for the old voice, it looks like the girl servant.The director of Maia took a look and said with a smile: "Gilmer adultsLord Lampson, this girl is the brother-in-law of the Lion family of the Magnolia Empire.This box is booked in the name of the Lane family."" The Lion family? "Lampson, Gilmer startledThe Lion family, the top five superstars in the Magnolia Empire, the oldest in the Magnolia continent, can be ranked among the top five families in the Magnolia Empire. Any one of them can easily kill the Debus family.The children of the Lain family are mostly in the Magnolia Empire and have a huge power network in the Magnolia Empire."Gilmer, the past first magic genius of our Ernst Magic Academy, Dixie, is like the Lion family of the Magnolia Empire."Lampson askedGilmer is more familiar with the Ernst Magic School"Yes, not just Dixie.What's the name of his sister? I can't remember.The two brothers and sisters are studying at our Ernst Magic School.However, a few days agoDixie has applied for graduationGilmer said directlyLampson also nodded"It seems that the girl is Dixie's sister."Lampson looked at the boxThe second floor of the Lane Family in the boxDelia face in a purple suit to sit quietly on the sofa, looking through the window below the ‘wake up’ stone sculpture"Miss, don't fight, but who can't make it below?The old man said with some anxietyAs a super family of the Magnolia Empire, the Lions’ family is very clear about the potential of the entire Magnolia continent, as well as some super masters.They understand that although they are super-family, some people cannot offend.For example, the following young man who appears to be only forty or fortyThe old man is very clear that although he has been over four hundred years old this year, but it is estimated that when he was not born, the man in this loose robe is now like this one."Don't worry, Grandma, you'll help me give this note to him, can you?" Delia took a pen and quickly wrote a sentence on a piece of paper and handed it to the old man.The old man took this note and saw that the content was not a moment"Miss, you, how do you..." The old man was shocked by the content"Don't worry, you can give this note to him.Delia did not hesitate at all. The old man hesitated for a moment and finally left the box to the first floor."12 million coins!" Delia's crisp voice rang from the boxThe man in the loose robe below wrinkled his brow, and his breath began to condense.At that time, the old man named Hugh had already approached the man in the loose robe and walked in front of the loose robe man and bowed respectfully. "My dear, I'm the servant of the Lions family. This is my lady. LetterThe man in the loose robe frowned and took this piece of paper with great interest.“Yeah...” The loose robe looked bright as soon as the man looked at the content, and then he laughed."Okay, well, I don't dispute, I don't dispute it.The paper in the loose robe man's hands was directly converted to fly ash. The man in the loose robe himself sat down with a smile and looked up at the box where Delia was on the second floor.At the moment of the third floor of the auction hallLei and yalu heard a crisp ‘1200 gold coin’ and both were surprisedThis sound is too familiar, lei is the same as the owner of this sound is from the newly entered Ernst Magic School to know"Yes, Delia"Yale's surprise roadLei immediately got up and walked to the other side of the window, walked to see where delia was in the boxSure enough, Delia, wearing a more serious purple suit, was sitting on the sofa, staring at the stone sculpture below, dreaming."3,2...1, oh!" The blonde host rang the hammer and shouted with excitement. "I'm honored to congratulate the Lion family for auctioning the lion's C gold coin at a price of 12 million gold coins. Announced that the stone carving 'Wake up' has become the third highest price among the top ten stone carvingsOnly Hoover’s ‘Blood Eyes’ Lion’s Guard’s, and Prokhor’s ‘Honor’ two works’ prices surpass this ‘Wake Up’"The entire auction hall was noisy, and warm applause rang.Lei is standing in front of the third floor of the window, watching the delia below, and then turned to see Alice in the other boxThe two girls are sitting on the sofa, but there is a smile on Delia's face, and Alice is pale.
