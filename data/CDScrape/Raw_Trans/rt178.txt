In the sea of ​​endless blood, the bones and bodies are also different. Some bodies are giants of nearly ten meters high. They are full of scales and have double heads on their heads.Some bone skeleton flashed a touch of strange golden ... ...

At this moment, Lin Lei more pressure to suppress the heart killing impulse, that kind of impulse becomes more and more intense, lei's eyes are more and more red"whatLei yelledAll of a sudden, Lin Lei rushed from the top of the mountain to the underside as if it were the same wind. The purple blood soft sword in his hand flashed like lightning, and the broken trees and broken stones collapsed into ruins.Bebe looked at lei so crazy rushed down the mountainHesitated for a moment in placeBebe is terrified of the terrible and unprecedented fearBut for its boss... "Yeah!" Babe clenched his teeth, slamming down from the hill and stumbling past....... At the foot of the big mountain at the base of the lei, there is a clear blue lake. In fact, a group of golden-eyed lions lives on the shore of the lake. The golden-eyed lion owl belongs to the social group of Warcraft. They are different from ordinary leopards. World of WarcraftIn general, the leopards and tigers of Warcraft may gather together during a major war, but they usually live in different places.However, the gold-eyed lion owl is differentAnd the gold-eyed lion owl, group awareness is very strong, and good at cooperationGold lion 獒 minions attack amazingThis group of gold-eyed lions has more than one hundred feet, although the Golden-eyed lion owl itself is only eight tiers of Warcraft, but is generally nine World of Warcraft does not dare to provoke themThey are undoubtedly the overlords of this generationAt this moment... this group of golden-eyed lions does not rest on the grassy shores of Lake Bihu, either casually walking on the shore of the lake or jumping into the lake to swim happily.Now is not the time to go out to prey. With their power, there is no need to worry about catching food.Many gold-eyed lion owls suddenly watched back to the direction of the mountains, with their sensitivity to complete feeling that there were creatures quickly approaching here.The gold-eyed lion cubs who had been squatting were standing up one by one and watched with cold eyes the direction that the creature came from.Gold LionsIt is three meters high, six meters long and golden brownLooks like a lionBut their eyes are strangely goldenThe heads of the 吼 ~ ~~" group of golden-eyed lions suddenly froze up.They finally saw the creature that had challenged them - it was a human being who was holding a monster and a purple sword in a faint red fog. This group of highly intelligent gold-eyed lions had a light heart, Human beingUnless it is a sanctuary, it cannot be moved at all.But in a flash - when the humans approached, when the red fog covered them, all the golden-eyed lions felt unprecedented fearThis is even more horrific than the threat of Sanctuary.Under the pressure of this radon, all the golden lions felt that their limbs seemed to be out of control and one by one fell into fear.Low noble head"Blood, blood..." lei tried to maintain his sanity, but he felt the longing for bloodInspired by the deep bloody feeling inside the Zixue Soft Sword, it is necessary to let the Zixue soft sword drink enough blood."Oh!" The purple blood soft sword turned into a purple streamer and passed directly over the neck of a golden-eyed lion.A huge head with a foot and a meter high throws up directlyLei is too fastNo, accurateIt's too quick to kill a slayer's soft swordWhen the head of eight golden-eyed lions was cut off, the first golden-eyed lion's skull was flying.It was also the moment that all the feared Goldeneye lions fully understood this"吼 ~ ~ ~" not far away, the largest size of the gold-eyed lion skull head hard to stand up and looked up and ranted upEven if it was so, his limbs were still a little trembling, and there was still a scary fear in his eyes.But their wisdom is highThey all understand that... In front of this human being that has spread an unprecedented level of terror is to kill them.Although fear, but they still have to resistPurple blood soft sword with blood, cheerful sword snoring"Dead, die!The more the killings were, the more the lei felt as if the heart had been caused.At this time he just wants to killMore than one hundred gold-eyed lion cubs did not dare to face lei at all, and they had to run away one by one."call outLei's purple blood soft sword to a golden eyeThe first gold-eyed lion owl knows it can not escape, reflexively opened the bloody mouth and bite to the lei, while the mouth also naturally blazing a hot flame, lei surface naturally emerged in the green and black dragon blood grudge shield, blocking This golden-eyed lion 獒 instant flame <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> when the purple blood soft sword approached the golden eagle, The golden-eyed lion cub is clearly aware that the helium pressure is several times larger than the original. This unprecedented fear has even made his limbs soft, and even the energies of the body's magic crystal nucleus have stagnated.Just let the head of the zixuan soft sword cut it.Lei shrouded in substantial air pollutionConstantly killing the Goldeneye GriffonThe golden lion lions that dominated the king were really panicked at this time. They did not know where to emerge from such a blasphemy.The sturdy gas was so strong that they had problems with their bodily functions.Even if they want to desperately work, the body is completely out of controlBlood splatterThe staggering limbs and the head flies in the sky... In the blink of an eye, more than 30 heads of golden-eyed lion owls died on the ground."Boss, bossBabe called anxiouslyBebe also sensed the status of lei at the moment, he also feared that lei really become a madmanGradually, Lin’s figure also stopped"Bebe, I'm fineLei sounded in beibei's mindBebe immediately squatted in the past, beibei clearly see the moment the lei ** upper body, forehead is full of sweat, even the skin is slightly reddishLei is closing his eyes at this moment, his chest bulging like a bellows"Call ... ..." long exhaled breath, lei finally opened his eyesAt this moment, lei's eyes resumed the normal normal wakefulness"Boss, you, what's wrong with you?" Babe worried aboutLei glanced at the hands of purple blood soft sword, at this moment lei is very sure, this zixue soft sword is definitely a killing sword, and killing people is not the averageLei even suspected that the dead bodies and bones in the blood that appeared in his mind were the masterpieces of this zixue soft swordOnly those corpses ... lei actually couldn't even recognize its race"Having a tauren person's race? Is it the legendary other heterotopian Tauren?" lei doubted to think, from the book lei also saw the books introduced TaurenBut there is no Tauren on the mainland of Magnolia.And those dead bodiesMany of the books that Lin Lei read were not available.For example, the species is ten meters high, the body is full of thick scales, and there are two huge sharp corners of the colossus, the body emits breath alone, it makes lei feel scaredLei felt that kind of monster, definitely not worse than some of the sanctuary he sawBut there are countless corpses of that kind! Yes, the breath is not as good as the corpse of the Sanctuary. It is almost everywhere in the sea of ​​blood.“This purple blood soft sword, who was the former owner? Killed so many strong ones.Lei heart scaredHe is also very sureThis handle of purple blood soft sword is definitely a high-level plane, because there are not so many strong players in the Magnolia continent.When I think of the scene where the purple blood soft sword was first obtained, lei understandsThis zixue soft sword is indeed not a plane of the Magnolia continent.Lei heart move, will be the purple blood soft sword into the space ring"Whuh, it's not necessary to evoke the air inside the Zixue Soft Sword less than necessary.Lei secretly made a decision in his heartBebe jumped on lei's shoulders at this time"The bosswhat happened? Bebe askedLei smiled and looked at babe: "babe, do you remember when we were in the foggy valley, found that mysterious magic array? grandfather delin said at that time, that mysterious magic array is more complex than the sanctuary level magic array ,mysteriousThe purple blood soft sword is to assist the magic array, and this zixue soft sword is certainly not as simple as what I discovered at the beginning.Now, it looks like this” Bebe immediately concentrate on listening"This zixue soft sword should have gone through many and many killings, and most of the killings are strong, and the sanctuary ranks are even stronger! Because of this, this handle of zixuan soft sword contains a terrible belching.As soon as they were elicited, even the golden-eyed lion trembledBut goodThere are also disadvantages... Once activated, this zixue soft sword must see bloodOtherwise, the purple blood soft sword will not follow my heart” Bebe nodded"Big boss, this zixuan soft sword is really terrible. Just now, the sturdy gas trembled and my heart trembled, and my limbs shook.In that state, even if I reach the 9th level of Warcraft, I am afraid it can only play 50% of the strength.Bebe answered honestlyAs for the eighth level of Warcraft, under this evil spirit, the strength of ten percent is probably only 10%When activating the purple blood soft swordThe opponent will suffer a lot of strength due to the influence of helium.Even the level 9 of Warcraft is so affected, so you can imagine the benefits of this evil spirit to the fighting time."It's just that kind of tyrannical, crazy thinking about killing is really badOnce you start that gasI must kill a lot of creatures to calm down the kind of tyrannical madnessLei just experienced it again, the heart is very clearIf it is not necessary, don’t inspire it."Well, babe, take a look at the magic crystal nucleus"" Magic crystal core?
