After the second assassination of Keith and Keen's siblings, they really realized that the road to the county of the county of Cheshire would be full of dangers.There may be danger of being killed at all timesCan not help but their siblings also rely on the lei“Lee Brother, what do you think we should do in the future?” Gianni looked at lei and asked in her heart.At the moment, both Jenny and Keane feel that the future seems to be shrouded in the fog. They can't see the way to the future. They don't know what will happen if they continue.Looking at this simple sibling, Lin Lei comforted her: "Rest assured, a county town agent, I still have confidence to deal with."The current forest radar reaches eight levels, and after the Longhua, it is nine peaks."The black-printed clouded leopard ‘Black Lu’ is also a 9-level peak of Warcraft, and Beibei’s strength is no less than Heilu’s and Lin’s.This person combines the two World of Warcraft, as long as it is not a strong sanctuary, that is, no matter how many people may not intercept themJennifer and Keane heard lei's words and felt that they could not help but admire leiTheir siblings are not able to judge their real strength even for the current lei. In the eyes of their siblings, lei is a mysterious strong person.On the other side, Lambert saw this scene, and his heart was very happy.As long as Jennifer and Keane’s siblings are able to live a safe and peaceful life, his old servant is dead and willing.A strong person can ignore the other helping the rural siblings. This action alone is sufficient to Lambert’s appreciation of Lin Lei from the bottom of her heart."Hey!" "Hey!" "Hey!""I go to open the doorLambert laughed. "The waiter who might have sent breakfast arrived."""We are ready to eat breakfastLei smiled and led Gianni and Keane to the living room, and Lambert opened the patio yard at this moment. Two waiters who pushed the dining car came in."Bring these to the living roomLambert laughed."Yes, sir"The two waiters are very humble.Push the dining car forward separatelyIt was just a glimpse of the two in the process of progress, but a flash of resolutenessThis time, they came to assassinate Keane. Whether they succeeded or not, they must die.They knew in advance that the existence of the strong lei, whether it was lei or his black leopard, was enough to kill them easily.In the living room, lei sat down in the main seat.Keane and Jenny sit on both sides. Two waiters with a humble smile push the dining car into the living room."Sir, sir, is this roasted whole lamb?" The waiter opened the iron lid."Place it on the ground hereLei pointed to the side of the slate, while the black-printed clouded leopard ‘black lu’ was lying on the floor looking up at the roasted whole lambWith Heilu’s food intake, a roasted whole lamb can only be regarded as breakfast."Yes, sir"The waiter respectfully held the specially designed large chassis and placed the roast whole lamb directly on the ground.Bebe jumped straight pastA plan of claws, a roast sheep thigh was caught by itBlack recklessly glanced at Bebe, and then walked over and started to bite and eat."Sir, please"The waiter placed the plate in front of lei, and then placed another plate in front of Kean."The other waiter is also carrying the dishes on the table at the momentAt this moment - both waiters are leaning beside Keane, but Keane is not alert to the fact that he is excited to pick up his knife and fork and he must begin to enjoy the mealThe two waiters took a look at each other.The two hands became claws and pierced Keen's chest, head, throat and other vital parts.Four hands attack at the same time! Normally, the five-level and six-level fighters can easily beat the giant rockIs a four-level warriorYou can also poke thick planks directlyKeane, an ordinary teenager with weak strength, whether it is his head or throat, could not resist any attack.Too closeTwo waiters are too close to Keane and the distance is too closeSo short distanceIt's an eight-level warrior, I'm afraid I've just reacted and Keane is dead.Lei heard coldlyA demon-like purple light flashed and disappeared. Only the harsh screams sounded. The four hands of the two waiters fell to the ground."what"Gianni jumped up in fear"MasterThe next to Lambert reacted and tossed the two waiters to the wall with angrily, both feet, shaking the walls and shaking them.The two waiters humbly murmured, just looking at each other, with a hint of despair in their eyes.“You, how are you?” One of the waiters looked at lei with disbelief.At the time, they were only half a meter from Keene.Although the two of them were only four-level fighters, but half a meter away, it was estimated that they would not even need to blink. They would be enough to kill Keane.At this time, the strong will have no time to respond.Could not only react, but also cut off all four of his hands."It's strange why I reacted?" lei indifferently looked at them both, "an ordinary waiter, hands will practice to that point?" The two looked to their palmsThis time, the red-haired man led the elite archers as an elite archer.After years of hard work, the old man with his hands is very clear.The two waiters look at each otherFull of despairAnd their broken wrists are constantly bleeding. After a while, they will surely bleed too much and die.Only they knew that ... the mission failed. It was lei who let them go. Their captain and Lady Weede would not let them go."Don’t worry about them, we will start immediatelyLei said standing upGianni and Keane have also experienced two assassinations. This is the third time that they do not want to be twice as vulnerable.Keane is whispered: "Brother, this breakfast? Are we going to pack and take the food?" <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div >"NoLei shook his head, "after eating the heart of things, I suspect that there was poison"" Poisoning? Kean looked at the dishes in the dish but it was a fright"Bee ~ ~ ~" next to the babe is this time screamed to lei, lei to see babeCan't help laughing"Yes, you are not afraid of poison, let's goLei said helplesslyIn fact, Warcraft and human beings have great differences in their physical structure. Many of Warcraft itself has toxic, human fear of poison, they may not necessarily be afraidThe more powerful World of Warcraft, the stronger the natural anti-drug abilityAnd World of Warcraft is usually living in the primeval forest and other places, from childhood will be exposed to some toxicThis generation of generations, natural resistance to Warcraft is stronger than natural generation******* lei them a group of people this early morning and left the hotel directlyAnd the red-haired man looked away at a group of people away from lei, and his face was even more ugly.“Ray?” the red-haired man murmured. “What happened to such a master, but it’s still happening with these two country siblings."The red-haired man is very insecureThe assassination of Keane, Gianni, the task was originally very easyLambert's old servant, strength is nothingIt was originally an easy task and suddenly emerged as a mysterious master, but it was thorny."No way, I can only report to my wife."The red-haired man knows lei's powerfulHe does not dare to take risks... O'Brien empire, as the first military power in the Magnolia mainland, has a very perfect communication system. This is a five-tiered Warcraft squadron of the Qing Dynasty.Throughout the O'Brien Empire, there were several Qingfeng statues in each of the county towns. There were special people who controlled these Qingfeng statues.The Qingfeng carvings are also highly intelligent. They know the way. Under the master's order, they can send letters to the places they need to go.It is only that the Qingfeng Diaoyu has to be an Imperial Crown official to qualify for use.In general civilians and even nobles are not qualified to useOf course, there is also an independent messaging system in the army.Red-haired man with a letter from the owner of the county town of ShareBlack Rock City sent a Qingfeng sculpture to the county town of Shire.... The speed of the straight flight in the sky is far more than the speed of the ground running. Soon after a group of people such as Lin Lei left Blackrock City, the Qingfeng Sculpture came to the county of Shire.The city of Hear, this is a relatively large cityIn the northwestern province, it is also ranked in the top ten. At the moment, the atmosphere of the castle owned by the landlord is very depressed and gloomy.The owner of this castle is Lady Weede! A lady who is famous for being cold and proud"younger sisteryounger sister"Two middle-aged men sprinted into the back garden of the castle grounds. At this moment, graceful and wealthy Lady Widdle is serving in the maid, enjoying the sunshine."What's the matter, my two brothers?" Mrs. Weed looked up at the two middle-aged men."Sister, this is a letter from the Communications Department. This time the mission has failed.The man of two men was slightly fatter"Failed? How was Codd so useless?" Mrs. Widder took the letter and opened it, her brow furrowed, wondering."A mysterious strong man with a black leopard?" According to the red-haired man's 'Cod' letter, the black leopard is at least Level 8 of Warcraft, and that mysterious man is naturally at least level 8 strong, even at level 9 StrongMrs. Widder suddenly felt that this letter was heavy"Sister, what should we do?" Mrs. Widder's brother, the fat man askedAnd Widder’s second wife also looks forward to watching Lady Weed.Mrs. Wade frowned and thought"Two older brothers, you go to Halmo Pharmacists.Mrs. Weed said calmly."Hall ink old monster?" Her brother immediately screamedMrs. Weed said bluntly: “According to Codd’s investigation, the mysterious man named “Lei” is at least a class 8 powerhouse, even a class 9 powerhouse.I can not kill a nine-strong playerIt's still good for Hormo pharmacists to do it.The Hallmer pharmacist, after all, had precedents of killing nine strong men."" But Holmerhe ... "Mrs. Widder's elder brother also has some hesitation"HumphIf you both go on like this, you can never be a big deal.Even if I kill Keane, you are like this and want to be the Lord of the City? Mrs. Weed made a cold bang“Okay, sister, we’ll go to the Hallmore pharmacist!” Two of Wives's brothers succumbed.... Hallmer's pharmacists call it Hallor Mo himselfSome people think that Hallmer is a killer, but Hallmer thinks he is a pharmacist.Indeed, Hall's ink is highly capable to save people. Holme ink has already been more than three hundred years old this year. It is almost impossible for a six-level warrior to survive until three hundred years old.But Hallmer did it, and it looks like Hall ink is still very goodIt was because Hormitch had taken some weird herbs all year round that he actually made his 300-year-old body as strong as an adult."Oh, Mrs. Weed really is generous enough. This time the business can be done, you can do it..." Haller stroes the slightly beard and smiles contentedly.Mrs. Widder’s two older brothers are still somewhat restrained in front of Hallmer’s"Hall ink pharmacist, you old still leave early"Mrs. Widder's eldest brother urged," Our local people will take you to see your goal this time.""Haha, you pay half of your deposit first, I'll start right away"Hormohaha laughs"The deposit?" The two brothers blinkedIn the county of Chilcher, the two of them didn’t really feel so unbearableBut when they heard of the story of Hallmer, their brothers did not dare to annoy the old man who claimed to be a Pharmacist.Once the old hair is picked up, nobody knows how many people will die(Chapter 1 to!)
