Lei looked at the group of people who rescued him. The old man in charge of the black robe and the person next to him were very strong.Otherwise, the Dark Vatican’s ‘arbiter’ will not fight or fight and will immediately escape.The old man in black robe, it gives a feeling of gloomy“As a referee, this is the result of the fact that for so many years that the Gyeongbuk tradition has continued, the internal system has not changed.This deputy referee should belong to the ‘Inquisition’"Drincowwater's voice rang in the mind of lei." In comparison, the mourner is even more terrible."Lessonists? lei could not help but cast their eyes on the sitterThe old man in long-haired hair wearing a linen cloth and bare feet had an ancient and simple atmosphere. When the ‘plumbearer’ looked at him, lei even felt a sense of spring breeze."The real strongLei heart tunnelThe old man in black robe looked to lei, and his face barely extricated a smile: "lei, you just go back to the holy capital with us first, and when you return to holy capital, those people don't dare to disturb you."Fenlay City, the Holy City of the Holy AllianceIt is absolutely amazing that the Holy See is not only Mingli in the city of Finlay, but also the hidden power in the dark.Whether it is the Dark Holy See or the four major empire, I am afraid that I would not dare to mess around in the Holy Land.In the city of Fen Lai Dong Cheng, a mansion on the Greenery Road, at the moment, Lin Lei is talking to Yale about living in the living room and talking about the battle of the knife"I have sent someone to ask about the third child. The patriarch of the Lucas family was totally unwilling to sell tactical swords. According to his words, their families did not lack money at all.Yale frowned and said, "I thinkIf you personally, you should be betterOf course, the premise is that they know your identity"The second magic genius of Magnolia's mainland history may even be a holy man in the future. This genius is probably the patriarch of the Lucas family."Then I will visit this patriarch of the Lucas family this evening.Lei is a must for the sword knifeHow can the family's inheritance treasures spread out? What's more, this is also my father’s greatest wish. The wishes of the family’s past generationsWhen LEI left home to Ernst Faculty of Magic, what his father said was still in his ear - "LeeRemember the wishes of our Baruch family for hundreds of yearsRemember the shame of our Baruch family! "" After you graduate at least six magician, as long as serious cultivation practice, it is not difficult to become a seven magicianPlus you are a double magician! The seven-level double magician is definitely a big man in the kingdom of Finlay. After you are completely sure to recapture the treasure of the family, if you don’t take it back, I’m even dead.Nor will you forgive you"..."I am even deadNor forgive you"Father is like a heavy hammer lying on the heart of the leiLei can not forget, as long as the ability, regardless of the price paid, he will bring the sword ‘mastiff’ to bring backThis is not just for family reasons, but also for my father."Anyway, we must get it backLei made a decision in mindSoft not, then hardOf course, the family's heritage treasuresIt’s good to be backTry to make the other party voluntarily surrender"The bossSimply we're outIt's ok to rob directly"Bebe's voice rang in lei's headLei watched huddled in his thigh bebe, could not help but pat it to a small head: "you do not trick” Bebe is not a small nose wrinkleSlammed and lain in lei's legs and closed her eyes and sleptAt this time, outside footsteps sounded. A middle-aged man in blue robes came in and said respectfully: “The Lord Yale, the Minister of the Kingdom of Finlay, 'Kelvin' is out. He wants to meet with the youngest of the lei."" Kelly, who? "Yaru brow wrinkledWhat is the general kingdom of the minister, Yale is too lazy to care“Master, did you not pay attention to the Lucas family during this time? This Kelvin is also part of the Lucas family."The middle-aged man in the blue robe said with a smile." Now the patriarch of the Lucas family is the uncle of Kelvin."Yale's eyes light up:" Let him come in soon"" The third child, it seems that the difficulty of getting back your family's treasure is reduced a lot."Yale smiled and looked at leiLei is also a little happyLei also looked to the doorway, a moment later, I saw a golden curly man smiling into the hallSeeing lei and Yale, the golden curly-haired man immediately humbly salutes: "Kelly, I met the youngest Yale and saw the young lei."" Kelly, why did you come to my brother? Yale asks rudelyKelly did not mind, smiled and said: "This time I came, with his majesty to invite the youngest lei, lin lei young master, do not know if you are willing to become the court magician of the Kingdom of Finland, your Majesty can also give you marquis, even You can also give you a large territoryLei laughedHe remembered the condition that the Red Archbishop of the Holy See had given him - that it could be in any kingdom under the sacred confederation, or even be duly ruled as a DukeYou don't need to do anything to enjoy this“Kelly, I can tell you that at the Academy of Ernest, the Archbishop of Bright Catholic Church invited my brother personally to give you more conditions than you can!” said Yale.Kelly said with a smile and continued: "The conditions are good. Your Majesty's meaning is to hope that Master Lin can stay in our Kingdom of Finlay."The rights of the six kingdoms of the Holy Alliance are not the same. If the Kingdom of Finlay is supported by lei, the royal family of the Kingdom of Finlay will become even more firmly established in the sacred alliance.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>After all...the Holy See is a king who is qualified to abolish a kingdom, and even directly destroys a royal family! The authority of the Holy See far exceeds the imperial powerThe royal family has a strong dependence, which is also very importantKellyLei finally opened upKelvin was slightly awkward and listened carefully"You are the Lucas family.Lei directly into the topicKelvin nodded with a hint of pride and said: "Yes, the family patriarch is my uncle.""I am the Baruch familyLei looked at Kelly. "I have a family treasure in the Baruch family."It was named after the sword, but this sword left my family hundreds of years ago.I now hope that I can get back this knife and kill it.As far as I know, the heritage of our family is now in your Lucas family.Lei said this, it will no longer continue to sayKelly Wrinkled"Fighting knife ‘slaughter’, the first Dragon Blood Warrior's weapon?” Kelly looked at leiLei nodded slightlyKelly wrote a moment and said, "Master Lin, honestly speaking, my biggest uncle is my uncle and he is old.Do not hold any positionHis biggest hobby is the collectionThis sword, ‘slaughter’, is a collection that he often shows off to outsiders.This treasure, worth nearly a million gold coins, is also the most precious collection in our family.It can be said that this collection is the lifeblood of my uncle. Let him let go. This is very difficult.Lei brow creaseAt the beginning, the sword knife 'slaughtered' only sold 180,000 gold coins, although the purchasing power of the gold coins hundreds of years ago was much higher than it is now.But in comparison, it is also equivalent to the current nearly 400,000 gold coins.And the other side says millions of gold coinsIt seems that ... the ancestors of the stigmatizing family had a low price to sell.KellyThis sword ‘slaughter’After all, it is the inheritance treasure that our family has inherited for more than 5,000 years. The importance of our family can be imagined.For outsiders, it is just a collectible, but for our family, the treasure of family heritage is lost and it is a shame.Lei face down"The family shame, I must washI will spare no effort for this sword to slay the slaughter.I meando you understand? Lei stared at KellyKelvin also feels a bitThe history of the Baruch familyHe naturally heardAfter all, he has this collection in his home.For a glorious family who used to cross the continentThe importance of the family's inheritance treasure can be imaginedThe Baruch family in the past was so weak that they could not careBut now, LEI is born ... ... do not say after the leiIt is now lei, it is not difficult to deal with their familiesAs long as lei speaks with the Holy See, he wants to recapture the sword and kill the family and shame the family.I'm afraid the Lucas family will have to admireOnce the matter is involved in the Holy See, it is serious."Master lei means I understand, I understand"Kelly's heart is a little weakLei smiled and looked at Kelly: "I hope you Lucas family, can understand my difficulties, I am a family brother, but also no way, Kelly, you go back and talk to your uncle, I will personally this evening Visit at home""We, the Lucas family, welcome you to the arrival of Master Lin."Kelly has already been thinking about how to persuade the old stubborn uncleLooking at Kelly's departure, there is a sense of superiority in lei's heart.Although he does not have any position yet, he has a reputation and is just talking to this Kelvin, letting the kingdom’s minister worry.All this is because of his own status, and his own position is also caused by strength.... that eveningThe living room of the old house of the Lucas family is very tasteful, and the dozens of people who are in the living room are both highly qualified in the Kingdom of Finlay.The lowest of these people is the Earl, and they are here to wait for the lei.Lei, a new star in the Kingdom of FinlayAlthough today's lei is only 17 years old, although he does not have any title, it is the Duke of the Kingdom who does not dare to despiseAfter all, these people have their own status and they can only make trouble in the Kingdom of Finlay. What about lei? It was a figure that was greatly valued by the four empires and the two major leagues.Perhaps decades later, lei became the archbishop of the Holy See and his position was even higher than the king of the kingdom.When the status of the other party is not too high, pull the relationship, it is naturally very importantOf these dozens of people, only the head of the Lucas family patriarch Jacob Marquis was very uncomfortable in the heart. He was older and had no other hobbies. His favorite was the personal weapon of the first Dragon Blood Warrior. He has always been proudBut... Now the sons of the other family come and ask for this treasure."Mr. lei, please"" Mr. Yale, please“The voice of the waiter outside the door entered the living room, and suddenly the dozen nobles in the living room smiled and looked out the door. Even the uncomfortable Earl Jeb also exuded a smile and welcomed it.Lei is the first time he is called ‘sir’ and is not used to itAt this time he also saw the silver-haired old man with his shiny hair combed over and smiled. He said very politely: "We very much welcome Lin Le and Yale to come to my Lucas family. My Jeb is the patriarch of the family. I am deeply honoredLei could not help but reveal a smileIt seems that there is a play on this thing!
