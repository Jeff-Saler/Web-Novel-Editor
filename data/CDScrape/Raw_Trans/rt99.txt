Ernst School of Magic just started school, Hillman came to the magic school to find leiIn front of the Ernst School of Enchantment, Hillman wrinkled her head back and forth, apparently full of emotions.The management of Ernst College is still very strict. He is not entitled to direct access to the interior of the college.After a while, both Yale wearing a sky-blue robe came over with Renault."You are, Uncle Hillman of the lei, right? I have seen youYale enthusiastically saidHillman also saw lei's three brothers. When they saw Yale and Renault, they immediately went over and asked, "Hello, I know you're a classmate with lei. I would like to ask, lei he didn't go back this time. What about the New Year? He used to go back in previous years.""This one? "Yale looks at RenaultLin Lei's romance is not a good thing, and it is not good for his eldersRenault responded quickly and laughed: "Uncle Hillman, ah, lei he is hard-working, as early as last year's end of the test before reaching the sixth magicianThen he again went to trials in the Warcraft Mountains.Hey, he was too eager to practice. He didn't even participate in testing at the end of the year.The Dixie, on the other hand, reached a level 6 magician this time. Others also said that Dixie was over LEI."" The youngest, do not care about those imaginaryBy the way, Uncle Hillman, Lin Lei. He went to the Mountain of Warcraft in mid-December last year. It is estimated that he will return soon. Do you have anything important to do? If you tell me, I will tell him the first timeYale said politelyHillman sinks for a moment, exudes a smile and shakes his head: "No, nothing importantOnly in the past few years, lei have returned to the New Year’sThis time did not return, the family worried about what he had come to askSince you know that lei went to trials in the World of Warcraft, it will be fine."Uncle Hillman, please rest assured that when the third child comes back, I'm sure to let him go back and let you rest assured."Yale immediately saidHillman shook his head and said, "No, no need to hurry lei back, let him feel good to practice, wait until he has time to come back later, anyway, we have nothing serious in the countryThank you two, I will go first"Yale and Renault watched Hillman leaveI smiled and turned awaySuddenly - "Yale, Lord Yale"The sound of enthusiasm sounded from afarYale and Renault turned to look outside the collegeThere was a carriage parked there, with four armored knights next to it.Yale frowned and wondered: "Who is calling me?Is Tony"Yale saw the face of the carriage windowAustani first jumped out of the carriage and smiled humbly at Yale, and then served respectfully, while the carriage curtain opened and a bald old man slowly walked on the crutches.Yale and Renault look at each other in disbelief"Who is this old guy?Reynolds whisperedYale shook his head and whispered: "I don't know this old guy, but I look at what Ortoni looks like.Should be a big guyOstroni is the upper management of the Pruxx Assembly Hall.Status is still highWith the accompaniment of Ostoli, the bald old man came over with a smile."Little YaleHello thereThe bald old man smiled and greeted Yale with a smile. "Not long ago, I met with your father. Did your father still praise me?Haha, Dawson He has you such a magician son, and it is indeed a matter of prideYale looked puzzled at the bald old manAlso said to know his father? Is it near? Osterny immediately said one side: “Master Yale, this is the chief curator of our Prouks Hall. You can call him Director of Maia."No, you call me Maia Burber. I have had friendship with your father for decades."Bald old man said with a grinYale secretly scaredPlucks Hall, a place of artIn the entire Magnolia mainland, there are several branch citiesDon't look elsewhere. Just look at the Prouks Hall in the city of Finlay. The stonework in that hall, the sum of all the stone works is an amazing number.This is only secondaryThe important thing is status. As the chief curator of a holy place of art, the director of Maia is the topmost figure in the Magnolia continent. Even many Sacred masters have friendships with him.How can such a figure be small? And the Plucks Hall itself is also very strong armed forces, or how to protect so many precious stone carvings? “MajabelYale said humblyBarely, the director of Maia looked at Renault to the side: "This is?" "This is my good brother, 'Renault'." Yale immediately said, Renault also politely said: "Have seen the director of Maia"The director of Maia nodded slightly. From Renault's every move, he could feel that Renault had been taught very well since he was young.""Meabe, I don't know if you came this time?" Yale inquired.Although it was an inquiry, Yale’s mind also had some speculation: “The 80% is for the third year of the stone work “wake up”The last time before the Ernest college vacation, because lei had not sent stone carvings for a while.Ostroni came to inquireAnd to Tony Tony who came to the lei dormitory, he just saw the stonework that he visited in the dormitory.Seeing this, Ostoni was shockedOstroni, as a senior manager of the Prouks Hall, had a very vicious vision. He immediately recognized that this work by LEY was definitely one of the highest peaks in the stone sculpture industry and was definitely qualified to be listed in the stone sculpture industry. One of the top ten stone carvings'The most important thing is that this stone carving by lei is very large and one piece is comparable to the works of others.Like oil painting, the price of stone carving is also related to volume.After all, the work of such a large volume of work must be much more painstaking, and that five consecutive real-life stone figures have reached the realm of a unique soul.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Seeing the stone carving is like seeing five real peopleLooking at the entire Magnolia continentMaster stone carving is also extremely rareThis lei's stone carving 'work' has already surpassed the average master and is qualified to join with some of the most outstanding stone masters in history - such as Prouks, Hopkinson, and Hoover.Now recognized as the 'Master of the Stone Carving', the work is indeed very good, but also has a unique charm, shocking the soulHowever, their work is still slightly inferior to those of Prouks and Hopkinson, who are called 'masters'.Although only a little difference, it determines the difference of identity.The history of stone carvings has been hundreds of thousands of years. Most of the stone carvings of hundreds of thousands of years ago have been annihilated with the long rivers.Only a few special stone works can be passed on to the presentTherefore, nine of the ten major stone carving masters were within 100,000 years.And since the Magnolia Empire unified the mainlandFrom the 001 year of the Magnolia calendar to the present, there are only two people who can be tied with the predecessors - Prouks, HopkinsonHooverIt was a master of 100,000 years ago, a piece of work, Bloody Mane Lion. The special material made this work pass down, and it also laid Hoover's permanent reputation.In the past 10,000 years, two master stone masters were bornOf course, Prouks is one of the most powerful in the past. One person has three works listed in the 'Top Ten Stone Carvings'. The 'Top Ten Stone Carving Masters' is not the place where each person has his work's 'Top Ten Stone Carvings'.This is only a later person's assessment, they are art works of stone carving worksIt is similar to the top ten stone carvings.Birth of a new stone masterAnd it's just a teenager just seventeen years old! This is how awkward things are. It also led the Plucks Hall Director from the Prussian Pavilion of the Dark Alliance.In no hurryWe went to a hotel in the hotel and talked quietly.The director of Maia is not too anxiousMaster stone carving? joke! Ostroni’s vision is good, but the art of stone carving, which has a long history, needs a very vicious vision to be fully assessed.Such as masterpieces of stone masters and representatives of stone mastersAll reach the point of containing unique charm and soulHow to identify this work is eligible to make one become a guruThat’s an extremely advanced knowledge******All four had a cup of tea in front of him. The director of Maia smiled and said: “Austony’s kid saw the work of lei, and told me that this work is comparable to the 'top ten stone carvings'. Haha, that’s not to say , with a 17-year-old stone master? "Master, represents a status, on behalf of this art he reached the topNormal people call them mastersFor example, Prouks“The guru of the stone carving?” Yale was surprised. “I don’t know if the stone works of Lin Lei are so powerful.After all, my vision is not high enoughHowever, I'm sure that the stone works of Lin Lei can at least catch up with the works in the “Master Gallery” of your exhibition hall.""Oh"The director of Maia smiled." Well, when I say so much, I still see it as well.I don’t know where the stonework is. Can I see it? ""of course canYale smiled and said“Little Yale, even if this stone carving work can't reach the level of 'Top Ten Stone Carvings', it’s estimated that it will not be much worse.What about your protection? Don't be stolen.The director of Maia reminded meYale confidently said: “While Maia Burber is assured, the stone sculpture is now placed in the interior of the Waltham Hotel and is protected by a master of my Dawson Chamber of Commerce.Not to mention, few people now know that this stone carving exists"" You transferred to the hotel? "Ostoni was surprised toThe last time he saw it was in the dormitory.Yale snorted: "I believe I have several good brothers, but I don't believe you"Ostoni could not help but smile"Meia Burber, go, I'll take you toYale enthusiastically saidWah Dali Hotel is actually an industry owned by the Dawson Chamber of Commerce, which is why the senior staff of Hua Dali Hotel knew the identity of Yale.In a separate room at Huadeli Hotel, the rooms are very spacious and there are beds inside. There are three masters who have been guarding these days."Yale young master"Three seven soldiers stood up respectfullyYale smiled and nodded. "Meia Burber, you see it“Speaking of Yale, the thick cloth on the stone was lifted at once, revealing such a large-scale stone sculpture, and the five beautiful stone carvings were just beautiful and lovely, with a lovely appearance, a lovely innocent look, and a shy look. There is a warm and moving appearance, but also a feeling of desperationAll real peopleLooking at the five humanoid stone statues, the opening mouth of Maia’s curator was so open and he looked at it for a long time in shock.After a long time... "Wonderful, wonderful"The Director of Maia just sobered up." This work is at least a masterpiece, and it is possible to sculpt five stone sculptures in real life. How much effort will it take? The time for carving alone will probably require a year and a half.The director of Maia is very clear that carving is very intensiveIn particular, a stone sculpture was carved, and even when a stone carving master was sculpting, he vomited his blood and fainted. In history, even more people carved and died.This work is completely painstakingly made"A teenager just seventeen years old can reach this point. It is really..." The director of Maia did not know what to say. He excitedly walked to the stone sculpture and carefully observed. "Is this stone carving capable of following ten? Compared with large stone sculptures, we also need to observe carefully from all aspects."Speaking of the director of Maia as if he had stuck a stone sculpture, he carefully looked at the traces.
