The president of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce, ‘Monroe & Dawson’’ “Law ~~”, many knights suddenly jumped at the same time and the horseshoe lifted high and eventually stopped."To release the young masterMonroe & Dawson immediately commanded that the nine-strong man who was responsible for escorting Yale's hair was moving and the tied rope broke straight. Yale immediately jumped off the horse. As for Renault, George II. People have already jumped"Third, you are really fine"George's eyes are red with excitement"The youngest, great, I know you will be fineYale excitedlyGeorge is a little hammered by lei, but he did not speak"The youngest, go and leave with us"Yale immediately said that Monroe & Dawson also said out loudly:" This is lei it, go with us, as long as it is not sanctuary Warcraft, our security is absolutely no problemMonroe & Dawson also wanted to make lei a member of the sanctuary who lacked the Dowson Chamber of Commerce! "No, I still have things. Yale boss, second child, fourth child, you go first."Lei shook her head and said"The youngest, do you still want?" Yale exclaimed, Yale already guessed what lei had to doLei nodded: "yes"Clyde, must kill! The last time it failed was because of the Sanctuary of Warcraft, but LEY believes that a king of the kingdom can have a holy magical reel that has been hard to come by. LEI does not believe that Clyde will have two St. Field Magic ScrollAnd now that the sanctuary of the Temple of Light is difficult to protect, I am afraid that it would be impossible to protect a king.“Yale boss, where are you going and I’ll look for you laterLei said"This time too much of WarcraftI am afraid that the Ernst Magic School near the city of Finlay has also been attacked.We can’t go back to the Magic Academy. Renault and George waited until they were safe. They were all ready to go back to their families. As for me... I walked with my father first.Yale answeredGeorge and Renault both nodded"Well, I'll find you in the future. Yale boss, second child, fourth child, goodbye.Lei stared at his good brotherHe nodded a bit, then immediately leaped up without hesitation, and he went 100 meters away.Yale, Renault, George also understand that it will be difficult for the four brothers to meet again.Three people also immediately launched"Driving!" The Dawson Chamber of Commerce's cavalry team once again advanced******* Many families throughout the city of Finlay face the danger of genocide on this day, and the Debuss family is no exception.Bernard, the chief patriarch, was trampled to death with the first heir, ‘Kalan’, directly by the Sanctuary of Warcraft’s Purple Eyes Golden Retriever.The family has suffered even greater catastrophic failure to inherit the position of the patriarch within the Debus family.World of Warcraft has entered the Debus Family HouseGuards, servants, maids, and clan people died one by one, and the Debuss family was completely crazy. They one by one caught the valuable things and immediately fled in all directions.At this time, few people will think of others"Alice's sisterwhat should we do? Rowling was completely stupidAlice was born from the beginning and is now awake"follow meAlice immediately shouted, Alice was also a fourth-level wizard, and Rowling was a fourth-level warrior.This is really a good year for them.However, in the case of all five levels of Warcraft, they have no resistance at all.Alice with Rowling, rushed into the blue card room, directly removed two magic crystal cards from one box."Sister Rowling, these two magic crystal cards, each with 100,000 gold coins, are enough for us to live.We will go now"Alice and Roland married a magic crystal card and went straight out of the house."One of them is a magician and the other is a warrior.At least the physical quality is very good, it is also very flexible to run"Help, eh!" a maid desperately ran toward Alice, who was behind her.A wind wolf suddenly came to her side, facing her throat was a mouthful, the maid was staring at Alice, Rowling, some eyes in the eyes of the desire for lifeThen the eyelids will gradually fade.Rowling stupidly looked at this scene and completely shocked"Fast walking"Alice is holding off some silly Rowling. At this time, whoever has a charitable heart attack is simply dying."Not to mention them, that is, the 9th-class strongman would not dare to send charity.To know that in the entire city of Finlay alone, the Sanctuary of Warcraft will be a dozen, and the World of Warcraft 9 will be nearly one hundred.The more low-level the more, especially the fifth and sixth level of Warcraft, such as the Wolf groupThere are hundreds of thousandsThe residents of the entire city of Finlay are only over a million.While most residents have only one or two levels of strength, there is no resistance at all."Oh!" Alice, Rowling and the two weak women tore the wedding dress and make themselves run faster"Alice's sister, in front of WarcraftRowling immediately shouted"This sideAlice dragged Rowling and went straight to the side alleyHowever, through the lane of the alley, it is clear that there is a World of Warcraft at the end of the alley. Alice and Rowling can only stay in the middle of the two alleys of the two houses."Hey ~ ~" on the other end of the alley, suddenly a bloodthirsty Iron Cattle ran in"Fast walkingAlice suddenly dragged Rowling and rushed out of the alleyRegardless of the front of Warcraft, anyway, there are still many people in frontThose World of Warcraft will not necessarily kill themBoth of them sprint hard forwardThick breathingLife and death moments make them nervous to the extreme"Oh!" "Oh!" "Oh!" ... suddenly from the rear dozen wind wolf chase over, the speed of the wind wolf is too fast, two of them faster than Alice, twice A dozen or so wind wolf chased it. At this time, Alice appeared in front of a large body of dragons.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> The size of the dragon, almost blocking half of the green leaf path, plus the dragon tailAlice, Rowling, two people, "Alice's sister"Rolene is desperateAlice looked at the two-storey height in front of the dragon, and looked at the rear wolf who had come back and rushed in. He couldn’t think of any other ways to escape."Are you dead?" Alice couldn't help but hold Rowling.At this moment, she could not feel the hope that more than a dozen heads of wolves rushed over to kill him.A glamorous purple glow flashesA dozen heads of the wolf flew up in the same place, and a figure burst into the sky at high speed, and then suddenly rushed to the giant land in front of the dragon."That was..." Alice and Rowling stared at the man who suddenly saved them.Alice sees it very clearly"This happened a long time ago."Alice's eyes looked at it with a bit of confusion, and it was lei who cameIn fact, the house of lei is close to the house of the debus family, and Alice and Rowling are now about ten meters away from the entrance of the lei house.Lei will not be at last"Drink!" lei twisted waist, power through the crotch to the legThe entire right leg was thrown away like a long whipLike the steel whip, LEI's right leg penetrated the air and slammed into the head of the dragon with the squeaking sound of sharp air.In the process of twisting, lei also appeared in the legs of the scalesHalf dragon! "Pang!" This foot is too fast. In the case where the dragon is not responding to the ground, he directly kicks the hard head of the dragon, brains crack, and the huge body of the dragon is falling down.Lin Lei immediately landedAlice and Rowling watched the shadows descending from the air, and some of them stayed"forestLei brother...” Alice said softlyLei looked back, brow slightly wrinkled, lei can now no time with these two women, and if let Alice, Rowling lonely outside, it is inevitable that lei suddenly saw a distant The cavalry troops rushed forward at a high speed. This cavalry team is carrying an old man riding a horse. It is the chief curator of the Prouks Hall.This time the World of Warcraft group attacked, the sculptures of the Prouks Hall were almost finished, as long as the important ones were put into the space ring by the chief curator of Maia.This space ring is extremely preciousThis one of Maia’s chief curators was also passed down by the family.“The director of MaiaLei shoutedThe director of Maia saw lei and was overjoyed: "Master lei, you are here“The chief admirer of Maia’s curator is the master figure of the stone carving master. The younger generation of lei who can admire the works of the masters such as Prouks and Hopkinson, will naturally admire it.Lei's assassination of clyde, actually know very few peopleOutside is a demon that assassinates ClydeThe director of Maia naturally also "Master leiLet’s go with us"The director of Maia is still very confident.Prussian Armed Forces, as long as it is not a sacred World of Warcraft hit, life insurance is absolutely no problem"The director of Maia, no, but I'll ask you for a favor.The two women have some relationship with me. Please take them to a safe place."Lin Lei to come to"No problem, but Master LEI, Finlay City is not safeThe director of Maia said quickly"No, I still have something. The two women will give it to you."EndLei directly into the mansion of the whole person entered the mansion, Alice, Rowling and the two looked two eyes, was reprimanded by the director of Maia immediately with the other people together a horse"He didn't even say a word to me"Alice suddenly feels sadHorseshoe sounds constantly, and Maia’s curator and his party left with Alice and Rowling.And lei came out of the mansion for a while. When he came out, lei had a black package on his shoulders.There are several magic crystal cards in this parcel, and there is also a hemolytic poison powder.Blue Heart Grass"Babe, now we go to the palace"" The bossWe're going to kill a lot” Bebe is also excitedLei even with bebe, rushed toward the palace******* Among the palaces, many people have begun to flee, but Clyde has entered the treasure house of the palace.How can Clyde give up the wealth accumulated by the royal family over many years?The wealth of a royal family is very scarySuch as the Debus family, family wealth has nearly 100 million gold coins.But a corrupt finance minister, the Duke of Padson has nearly 100 million gold coins.As for the wealth of the treasure house of the palace, it is much more than this.Treasure house“I have accumulated wealth from generations in thousands of years in the kingdom of Finlay."Clyde looked at a lot of treasures in the treasure trove, too late to think too muchDirectly put a small amount of precious treasures directly into the space ringAs a king, Clyde was lucky to have a space ring"There are these thirty-two magic crystal cardsClyde looked at the magic crystal card in his handsThe thirty-two masterless magic crystal cards are the accumulation of the kingdom of Finlay for thousands of years. Each magic crystal card has 100 million gold coins.Thirty-two sheets are ‘3.2 billion’ coinsThis figure is terrible. I am afraid that some of the four major empire families do not have so much wealth.People say that when the king is making the most money, and thousands of royal lands are accumulated, wealth is amazing."The capital city of 'The City of Finlay' is overClyde glanced back at other treasures in the treasure house, leaving only one biteBut Clyde didn't know that it wasn't that Wang Duofen and Laicheng were gone. Actually, the entire kingdom of Finlay is already a paradise for World of Warcraft. He is no longer a king. Actually, it is not only Kingdom of Finlay. The territory of the Holy Alliance is being eroded by World of Warcraft.
