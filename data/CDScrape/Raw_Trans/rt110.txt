The middle-aged blond stood on the stage and continued to talk highly: “When it comes to the stone, the lowest price among the top ten stone carvings is 528 gold coins. The highest price is the sculptural work Bloody Lion. It is the new transaction price of the Prouks Hall auction hall in the Magnolia Empire recently, up to 13 million coins! The following nobles and rich people are quietThis price is indeed very scary“Blood-faced lion cubs are based on the sacred field of Warcraft, the bloody lion's eye, and the sculptors are the 100,000-year-old carving master ‘Hoover’.In the past 10,000 years, two master class figures have appeared on the mainland of Magnolia, including Prouks and Master Hopkinson.The two also reached the level of master"The middle-aged blonde suddenly laughed.“However, as far as I know, any guru in history, not to mention a master, is an ordinary master-level figure. When they are honored as masters, most of them are over a hundred years old.Is not a hundred years old, but also seventy-eight years oldWho became a master before he was 30? "The middle-aged blond looks down:" No, but now"" Great lei master, he is a geniusAt the age of seventeen, only seventeen years old, he turned out to be a seven-level double magician. In the field of magic, he was also ranked second in the history of Magnolia mainland China.And at the age of seventeen, he also knew the level of his works of sculpture."Speaking, the middle-aged blonde turned to look at the stone ‘dream wake’The two maids immediately stepped forward and opened the Mongolian cloth, revealing the true meaning of the ‘dream’ stone carving.“This is the work of Master Lin Lei. According to the investigation of our hall, this work was completed during the heavy snowfall in December last year.This is the year when lei lei master is 16 years old.Middle-aged blond said with a smile, "I've always been wondering why the snow last year was so big. Now I think I'm afraid it's because of the reasons why this masterpiece was written.""The following nobles and rich people laughed."Well, gossip will not say more“The middle-aged blonde points at the stone carving of the ‘wake up dream’. “This stone carving has completely reached the level of a master. The most unusual thing is that the volume of this piece is very large and the truth is true.This work can be completely divided into five auctionsThe following rich nobles all laughed and talked with each other"of courseI'm just kiddingEach of these five humanoid sculptures has a unique charm, and the five combined together are more like a wonderful love story.I believe many people who have researched stone sculptures can feel this beautiful love story."The middle-aged blonde sighed:" Five human sculptures, each with a master level, and the combination of the five can also make people feel the unique story.The price of this stone carving, I can't guess"The most important thing is that when the master of lei completes this work,Only 16 years oldSixteen years old"Blond middle-aged people are loud"I didn't feel the lack of language at all for a moment. I couldn't express myself in language. I admired the master lei.He is really a genius! ! ! "This remark has also caused the rich people below to resonate.At the age of sixteen, it is a miracle to complete such a work.And in the Debus family room, it was a silence"Awesome guy"Ka Lan is very resentful of this blond middle-aged man.Because after he said soI'm afraid the price of the stone ‘waking’ will be higher"I cannot imagine the achievements of Master leiIt is precisely because of this that the masterpiece of SHI Lei's first name Zhen Zhen Yulan mainland is even more rare.UghIt's a pity that I don’t have much money, or I’ll buy it if I’m going bankrupt"The fair-haired middle-aged man said with a smile." Well, now that the auction is underway, there is a reserve price of one million gold coins. Everybody has no idea.“One million gold coins! The reserve price? A lot of the aristocrats who had been lucky enough to be fortunate enough to be shocked suddenly, not the big family’s richest man, even the idea of ​​contending for this stone ‘waking up’ was gone."Each increase, at least 100,000 gold coinsThe middle-aged blonde added a sentence, "Yes, the work of lei's master works stone ‘dream awakening’ auction began."The entire auction hall was quiet"1.5 million coins!" directly bids from a nobleman on the first floorIn the third floor, the lei carefully listened to the following quotation, leibeizhong's ‘beibei’ also stretched out a small head and looked down"Boss, later roast chicken roast duck, and wine can be let me eat it"Bebe's voice rang in lei's head"no problemLei touched babe's headFor himself, Bebe is completely his brother."Yeah, I'm happy after that."Bebe's eyes glowed with excitement, and he looked at the neck as he looked down."

If there is no accident, I will still stay in the kingdom of Finlay.Lei said with a smile"You really should talk to your fatherClyde said, his brow slightly wrinkled. "LEI, as far as I know, your father seems to have left Wushan Town. I checked it, but I can't find your father's sight."It seems like... disappeared"<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> After lei became famous, Clyde asked lei to help him. RelativesBut Hogg is not in Wushan Town"My father is not in Wushan Town?" LEI has some doubts."My father, he may have gone to other places. His father is also in Wushan Town.""MaybeClyde did not continue to say moreHogg really hides deeply, otherwise a king of the country will find a person. Will he not find it? ****** The second floor of the auction hall"Five million gold coins, shit!" card blue cursedThe patriarch's chief Bernard, who had been gloomy, said in a low voice: "Khalan, you should also know the family situation. Now that the future of the family is unknown, we cannot waste too much money on it.According to the deliberation of the family, we can give up to 8 million coins to youThis is the bottom line"Card Blue noddedKa Lan is very clear that the entire family’s industry does indeed have a full 100 million gold coins.However, 100 million gold coins are mostly fixed assets.The flow of assets is about 20 million gold coinsHowever, families cannot always spend money on a stone sculpture.The family did not force Karan to separate from Alice."530 gold coins!" Some people in the second floor were quotedThe host middle-aged blond immediately excited: "5.3 million gold coins, the past ten stone carvings were the lowest price of 528 gold coins, and now the price of the top ten stone carvings has changed, I can announce that the stone carving' Dream Wake' already ranked in the top ten stone carvings"" The Dawson Chamber of Commerce Yale offers 600 gold coins! "The voice of Ostoni came from the third floor of the auction hallLight rain is not the person hears this price, card blue face is black againThe price so quickly reached six million coinsThis is indeed beyond the card blue to predictAccording to the card blue expectedThe last one of the top ten stone carvings is only 528 gold coins. It should be no problem to prepare 8 million gold coins for themselves.But... Kalan is not a real collector. There is no real study of stone carving.The real collectors can fully feel the place where the ‘Awakening’ stone carving makes people excited. In particular, the combination of five humanoid stone carvings is even more rare.In the history of the entire Magnolia continent, there have been no such five humanoid stone carvings united together, but also people can feel a beautiful feelingSpecial sculptor was only 16 when he was sculptedIt is a super magic genius"Can't let prices go up one step at a time"Card blue frownHe understands that letting prices go up slowlyYour own quote will be very low success rate"8 million coins!" Card Blue announced his price loudly.From six million coins to eight million coinsIt has risen by 2 million coinsThe magnitude of this dramatic increase is indeed shocking many people.After all, the price of the top ten stone carvings is the three most precious works of Prouks.There are also more than 7 million gold coins.Collectors are not blind collections but also value-seekingOtherwise blindly comparing, it is the act of spursThe middle-aged blonde immediately shouted: "The Debus Group bid 8 million gold coins, so neatly biding 8 million coins, you can see that they are on this stone carving topographyI can imagine that in the future, the master of lei has become a strong sacred place, the price of this piece of work will not be 8 million coins, and it is more likely to be 16 million coins."This blond middle-aged man really has a strong advocacy ability."There are few idiotsThey are also thinking... After all, there is money, but also valuable... On the third floor of the auction hall, lei, yaer, clyde, girmer archbishop, archbishop lapponn, etc. all looked down, chatting casually."The youngest, that card blue quotedYale whisperedLei could not help but look at the box, he can clearly see that in the box which card blue and Alice is holding her hand, see card blue's expression is obviously very nervous"No. 3, if I don't push him, no matter what, your stone carving can't fall into his hands." Yale whispered in the ears of lei"No need toLei slowly shook his headLei is staring at Alice, Alice in the box at the moment, if a miserable little girl, the rest of the Debus family look to Alice with a little dissatisfactionAfter all, their family is spending a lot of money for Alice."If they really want it, give themLei said coldlyNext to Gilmer and Lampson, they looked at each other and smiled.***** boxPeople in the Debuss family are all quite nervous. The most nervous people are Kalan and Alice."Reassuringly, Alice8 million gold coins are already extremely high pricesNot higher"Kalan comforts Alice, but isn't it comforting him? Because the family is only authorized to give him 8 million coins."And the blond middle-aged man also lifted a small hammer: "Dubs family bid 8 million gold, is there a higher bid? Then... I have to count down.""10 million gold coinsA slouching voice rang from the seat in the first floor lobby. Actually, the quotes behind the stone ‘Ming Wake’ were almost those of the super aristocrats in the van.The following nobles are just watching the show. I did not expect that there was a quote from the first floor lobby.“I really don’t look at it. I think this ‘wake up’ is basically a new school. The carving style and other stone carvings are completely different. There are five human figures with different charms, ten million gold coins, or a value."The man who reported 10 million gold coins said casually."This man, who looks like a man in his thirties or forty, wears a loose robe, and anyone who feels lazy will feel it."The 10 Million Gold Coin?" The card blue and Alice in the box were both stunned.
