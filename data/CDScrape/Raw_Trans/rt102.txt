Seven-level double magician, which is also considered to be the strongest in the entire Magnolia continent.If you add “17 year old” in front of a seven-level double magician, the effect is completely different.A seven-level double magician, I am afraid that the Holy See will not care, after all, Magnolia on the mainland is more powerfulHowever, ... seventeen-year-old seven-level double magician, not to mention the bright Vatican behind the Magnolia continent, I am afraid that any forces on the mainland will be jealous"Genius, Genius!" The eighth magician Delant's assistant dean got excited.The magic teachers around us were shocked one by one. The magic teachers all knew what the seven-year-old seven-level double magician represented.This is a miracle... at least the wonders of the Ernst Magic School! "Yay"Yale, Renault and George all laughed.They are always looking forward to seeing this group of magical teachers. This is really exciting.The strength of Deland's vice president was not the top three in the Ernst Magic School, but he also experienced storms, and quickly suppressed the excitement in his heart. The first one came to lei's side: "lei, you know Does the seventeen-year-old seventh-level magician mean anything?” “Is that still used?” Delincholw also appeared next to this, proudly plucking his own white beard, “I taught by Delincott The disciple who came out, how could that be worse?” Drew Corwater as the soul, the magic teacher who is present at the moment has a good distance away from the sanctuary, and he naturally cannot detect the existence of Delin Cowater."Seventeen years old"Drant sighed“My Ernest School of Magic has been ranked according to the ages from childhood to the ages. In the past seven generations of wizards, you are the youngest one, ranking first in history, and originally ranked first. At the age of nine, he reached the genius of a seven-level wizard and later became a sanctuary."A silver-haired old man next to him came and said: "Not to mention the history of the Ernst Magic School is the history of the entire history of Magnolia mainland.Magnolia reaches the rank of seven magicians from the smallest to the largestYou are also ranked second in historyThe history of the entire Magnolia continent has been much longer and more extensive in scope.Ernst Magic School can not compare with him"Historical second?" lei is also very shockedMagnolia’s historical talents are so numerous that he can rank second in history. This is a very scary figure."The history of Magnolia mainland ranked first, is a more than 8,000 pre-sacred mageHe became a 7th-level magician at the age of 16.History of the Magnolia continent ranked second, now ranked thirdHe was eighteen years old and became a seven magicianThe man eventually reached only nine magiciansThis was followed with a blow to himselfHeart changesYou can say that... If you don’t count on you, the top ten geniuses in the history of the past, six of them are sanctuary magi, and four of them are nine."General seven magician, is respected as a great magicianEight magician, honored as MagisterNine magician, known as the big magic guideSanctuaryAlso known as Sanctuary Mage, or Holy Mage"It's fair to say that with your material, it's absolutely no problem to be at least a nine-level wizard.And what you need is only timeAnd if you continue to work hard like this, the hope of becoming a sanctuary is very great.After all, you are now the 7th magician in history."The silver-haired old man looked at lei and said seriouslyLei is looking forward to the sanctuary, but hope is not too greatBecause lei understands a thing, the magician is harder to advance than the warriorWarriors, like magicians, need mental power.However, the degree of spiritual force needs is not the sameThe magician does not cultivate the body but only specializes in spiritual power.Most of their experiences are spent on the cultivation of spiritual power. For magical power and control over the elements of the world, they all need spiritual power.A powerful magician whose spiritual power is equally powerful and terrifyingThe soldiers are not the sameIn comparison, soldiers are the most importantThen it is spiritual power and grudgeWith a strong body to withstand enough vindictivenessSpiritual power is for better control of vindictive useFor example, a seven-level magician is compared with a seven-level warrior.Spiritual power may differ by nearly ten times"Even if I can practice to Sanctuary MageHowever, the time spent must be very longAnd with my Dragon Blood Warrior talent, it is estimated that cultivation to the sanctuary is much faster.Lei is very clear about the history of his familyThe Dragon Blood Warrior generally takes only a few decades and can enter the sanctuary in a short time.And... A dragon blood warrior who stepped into the sanctuary was very powerful, and he was also considered as a top power in the sanctuary."LEI, you are the most successful student in our school. Please stay with you in these two days. I will ask the best painter, the best master of stone carving, and leave your portrait and your sculpture on us. College"Deputy Delant immediately saidThis is the second genius in the history of the entire Magnolia continent. Naturally, it is a kind of glory for the college."Portrait?" LEI YiyiHe remembered that in the face of a painter or stone master, he must maintain a posture for a long time. When he thought of that scene, lei could not help but feel that it would not seem like a wonderful thing to become the second day of Magnolia's history.****** Ernst Magic School has been the first genius in history, the second day of the entire history of Magnolia mainland.Only seventeen years old, it has already reached seven double magiciansThis shocking news quickly spread throughout the Ernst Magic School at an alarming rate."Seven double magicians? Only seventeen years old? How is it possible?" "There are still fakes. There are so many magic teachers in the school. And Delant has asked the painter to prepare a portrait for him. Always stay in our college"" God, seventeen years old on the seven magicianAt this rate, it will be eight in ten years and nine in twenty years.He is also the 9th-year-old devil.It is estimated that before they are a hundred years old, they can become Sacred Mages."<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "I just flipped through the library books and, in addition to Lin Lei, was historically ranked in the top ten. Great geniuses, there are six St. Magisters, and four are nine.Lei, it is too powerful"... The entire Ernst Magic School is full of this discussion, if a student's performance is slightly better than othersOthers may be jealousHowever, when a student’s performance reached the point where they looked up and reached the second highest point in the history of Magnolia mainland, some of them only admired and worshipped.In their hearts, lei's achievements since then are limitless, and they are incomparable.And there were still people who said that Dixie was the first talent in college, but no one said it now.Lei is without a doubt the college’s first genius, and is the absolute first genius in the history of Ernst Magic Academy for more than 5,000 years.Dixie is now only six magicianHe wants to reach the level 7 magician, who knows when to shake"LEI Lei, the Seventh Magician?" Dixie, who had just finished meditation, was silent when he heard her sister delia.Originally reached six levels above lei, his heart finally has a trace of balance, but now the news is to make him abyssLei's progress is too fast, he even desperately catch upWill also be thrown away by lei"brotherDelia whispered, delia worried a bit about his brother.Delia knows very well that her older brother is very proud of himself and treats others with coldness, and his own requirements are extremely strict.Her brother never obeyed others. Her brother could feel threatened after she quickly moved from the fourth-level wizard to the fifth-grade wizard.Her brother is very hard, last year reached the level of the sixth magicianBut lei is... "don't worryI'm fineDixie shook his head slowly. "Delia, I suddenly don't seem to have much use in college. I'm going to apply for graduation. I'll go back to my empire in the near future and go back to my family."Delia****** In a separate living room at Huadeli Hotel, this suite has four bedrooms and two living rooms.Still bigAnd now their four brothers are living here.Since the news of LiDAR to the Seventh Magician passed outNo. 1987 dormitory could not be leveledOften there are a large number of people visiting lei, forced to lei can only go to wadley hotelHuadeli Hotel has a profound backgroundNo one else can come"The youngest, you don't have it, it's amazing.Yale sighedLei smiled indifferentlyIn fact, this is the decision of lei and delin kowout to go out after the decision, today's Baruch family is still very weak, if you want to rise quickly, choose to announce the power of their own seven magician, is undoubtedly the fastest wayA 17-year-old seven-level double magician will be invited by all partiesNatural conditions will be very highIn this way, lei will start a lot later“I’m not hiding you in my third year. The “Dawson Chamber of Commerce” is one of the three largest chambers of commerce in mainland China.Is there any interest in our Dawson Chamber of Commerce? "Yale looked at the lei, actually Yale is looking forward to lei can enter the Dawson Chamber of CommerceThe second day of the Magnolia continent’s history, if such figures join the Dawson Chamber of Commerce, their status will certainly be high.This is also a great benefit to Yale’s position in the family."The Dawson Chamber of Commerce?" Renault exclaimed first. "Wow, Yale. Although you knew that you were Dawson's family, there were too many families called 'Dawson'.Did not expect that you were actually the Dawson family of the Dawson Chamber of Commerce? Dawson Chamber of Commerce, ah, that’s really too much money"George also looked at Yale"Yale boss, this ... ..." lei some hesitation"Don't mind, you're my brother, I'm not going to force you"Yale smiled and said," Others can not guarantee that if you join our Dawson Chamber of Commerce, then there is absolutely no problem with money.At least 100 million gold coins have no problem"" One hundred million gold coins? ” lei, george, Renault were all shockedOne hundred million coins, what a terrible fortuneThe total assets of the entire family of the entire kingdom of Finlay add up, I am afraid there are no 100 million gold coins are hard to say"LEI, your brother family is too rich, 100 million gold coins, really ..." even delin kowtor was shockedOne of the masterpieces of stone carving masters is over a million gold coins. It is already amazing.But what is the total number of such works? "I can tell you, my third child, this Magnolia continent, with the exception of the other two major chambers of commerce, the four major empires and the two major leagues, I am afraid that they will not come up with so many coins at one go.As for those kingdoms,Yale said with certaintyThe four empires and the two major leagues have their own strong sacred sites.However, the four empires and the two major leagues must maintain a large army and maintain the entire country.Although they are rich, they need to get 100 million gold coins at a glance. It is very difficult.At least need to be consulted internally by multiple partiesFor a master who is not yet a sanctuary, they will not do it.Only three major chambers of commerce, the wealth of the three major chambers of commerce, and the horrors of astonishmentAlthough their force is strong, they are far behind the four empires and the two major leagues. Therefore, they urgently need to join superpowers."Oh!" "Oh!" "Oh!" suddenly knocked on the doorYalu brow wrinkled and walked past and opened the door and said: "I didn't say it, don't come to disturb us?" said the head of the Huadeli Hotel: "The Lord Yale, the red cardinal of the Holy See with three White ceremonial ceremonies and a Knights of the Temple have come outside the hotel"Yale's GlanceThe status of the bright Catholic Church is second only to the Pope's red cardinal? The status of every cardinal is much higher than the king of a kingdom.The Red Cardinal himself led the horse. This is not the master of his Dawson Chamber of Commerce can stop it."The attraction of the youngest is really strong enough.”……
