Without talent, you cannot become a magician.This is recognized by many people! However, Drincowout dares to say that even if the talent is not good enough, he can develop a magician.If this is what others say may be bragging, but it is more than five thousand years ago, the Holy Land Mage! "Low talent, low achievement?" lei heart slightly startledThe reason why he wants to become a magician is to be able to reproduce the glory of the Baruch family, even if it does not reach that level, it can realize the desire of the patriarchs of the Baruch family for centuries - the treasure of family heritage. Back, it is enough to achieve thisHowever, to achieve all this, strength is very important"LEI, don't worry, your magic talent hasn't been tested. Who knows if it's high or low? Maybe your talent will be very good.“Drinkovt touched the white beard and said with a smile.Grandpa Delin's calm, but also made lei heart down"Grandpa Delin, how to test magic talent?" lei could not help but look forward to it"Test magic talent, it is very simple"Derrinkovt's words just came out, suddenly - only heard footsteps outside the door sounded, lei could not help hurried up and quickly whispered to Delin Kewo Te said:" Grandpa Delin, you quickly hide ,somebody is comingIf the sanctuary of the Sanctuary of the Puang Empire was discovered more than 5,000 years ago, it would be bad.Drinkovt is smiling, not moving at all."Drlin grandfather -" lei a little worried"Oh!"The bedroom door opened, I saw the housekeeper Xiri looked into the room and saw lei actually woke up, could not help laughing:" lei young master, did not expect so soon you woke upLin lei young master, now feel better? Lei immediately exhaled a smile, nodded: "thank you Grandpa care, I'm much better nowLei's heart is a big urgency, but also can not help but look at the direction of delinkowat, delin kowtor still standing with a smile: "this delin grandfather how is it? Hey, to be discovered, it is troublesome to explain it."" lin lei young master, to eat lunch, since you all wake up, go eat it together"Shiori said with a smile"Oh, I knowLei took a look in the direction of delin kowtor, my heart puzzled: "how is it going to see Grandpa's appearance, as if she can't see Delrin's grandfather"The housekeeper Shirley saw lei several times toward an empty place next to the bed and asked, wondering," Master lei, what do you see by the bedside? Is something falling down? I can help you"" No, nothingLei immediately crawled up from the bed. Grandpa Hirley, let's have lunch"The housekeeper Shiri felt a little weird from lei's reaction, but she didn't think much and smiled and nodded.Lei put on clothes and shoes, but still worrying about looking at delinkwaterAnd at the time of this, Deling Kewater smiled at lei, moved directly, disappeared out of sight within the scope of lei."Into the ring of dragonsLei felt very clearly this time there was a soul in the ring of dragons.Different from the past, after dripping blood to identify the Lord, lei's awareness of Panlong's ring has obviously risen by one level."LEI, don't talk. You can talk to me in my heart and I can hear it.You are the owner of the Dragon Ring, and I am the soul of the Dragon Ring. We can easily carry out spiritual exchanges."Drinkingwater's voice sounded in the mind of lei<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> This is what surprises LEI."Grandpa Delrin?" lei tried to speak"I heard"Drinkingwater's voice is also ringing in the mind of leiLei lei suddenly in the heart of a burst of joy, but patronize the exchange with delin kowold, but did not pay attention to the foot, a foot on the thresholdIn front of the housekeeper Shiri turned his head and smiled and said: "Leeon lei, walk carefully"" I know, Grandpa HeatherLei replied with a smileExcitedly chatting with Delin Kewot in the heart, and LEI sat down in the living room.Today's lunch is quite rich, and there is a fragrant roasted sheep. When Hogg saw lei coming, she smiled and said: "LEI, sit down!"Speaking, Hogg handed a roasted leg of lamb to LEI."Thank you father"Lee's heart is a bit surprised, the family economy is more difficult, so ordinary meals are very commonEven today it comes only to roast sheepLei does not know that... in the process of a large number of stones coming to wushan town, not only people but many animals have also been killed. Today it is not just the Baruch family. luxury"Grandpa Delin, how couldn't Grandma Hilley ever see you?" lei asked Dreincott in the heart"LEI, I want to tell you that other than you, others cannot see me at all.Because now I am in the form of the soul, the soul is nothing... the eyes can't see at allAnd you are the owner of the Dragon Ring, this can see meDeling Kewater answered carefullyLei heart suddenlyBefore Grandpa Delrin said, he died prematurely.

Lin was still very surprised."Not all people can't sense my existence. As long as they are equal to me at the soul level, they can feel my presence.Of course... as long as I hide in the ring of dragons, others will definitely not find it."Drincowwater's voice rang in lei's head“Soul level is quite equal to Delin Grandpa?” lei eats in his mouth and exchanges his heart with delin kowtor."Similar to my soul level, it should be the sanctuary. Only the strong sacred people can barely sense my presence.The precondition is that... I appear outside the Panlong Ring. If I enter the Panlong Ring, they cannot find me."Drinkovt said with a smileLei nodded in the heart, while holding a roast leg of lamb in one hand, ate and ate"lei, eat a little slowerHogg met with lei so quickly, could not help but laughLei smiled at his father, but eat the expressAfter a while, a large roast leg was eaten clean, and lei threw himself comfortably.
