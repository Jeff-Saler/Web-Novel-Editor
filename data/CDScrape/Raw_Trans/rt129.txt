Alice talks alone? Is the Debus family involved in smuggling and using it? Obviously this Merritt is not happyNimitz also experienced storms, and his natural heart was like a mirror.Nimitz blinked and looked at Meryl.And Merritt was lying comfortably in a chair, even closing his eyes and repose, not looking at Nimitz's eyes.Merritt's attitude is very clear - you want to let your family wash and feel wrong, let Alice come to talk to meNimitz squatted for a moment and then laughed: "Merritt adults love the lei lei stone sculpture of lei lei master. It is also understandable to talk to Alice.OK, I will go back and talk to Alice.“Melitat, who had been keeping his eyes closed, could not help but open his eyes and smiled at Nimitz, who was next to him.” Haha, then, Nimitz, please go back first.Just let Alice talk to me alone and I think I will know more about your Debus family."Nimitz immediately stood up, humble and courteous, said:" Lord Melite, I will say goodbye first, we Debus family to please adultsMeryl gently noddedNimitz immediately retiredAnd throughout the living room, the Duke of Merritt was aloneMelitt held a glass of wine and whispered in his mouth: "Goddess, Alice..." There was a trace of contentment and longing on his face.Merritt, who was the right side of the Kingdom of Finlay, was again dubbed the DukeStatus is respected. He is higher in the kingdom of Finlay than he is. One hand counts.Such as his character, what kind of woman has not seenMelite, indeed, likes women, and although he is now seventy years old, it can be equivalent to a life span of two to three hundred years for a fierce warrior.He is only seventy-year-old and is the strongestMerritt has only 12 wives who are publicHowever, one of the nobles has a more popular point of view - the wife of the family is not as good as the lover outside, but the lover outside is not as good as he is not.What is not available is the bestBut to Meryl this statusThere are few women who can't get himThe woman who can truly make him excited is also rare.Alice is one of them.Since the stone carving 'Wake Up' became famous, the woman in the stone carving in the hearts of many people is the ‘Goddess’! The goddess is unattainable, such as the status of Merritt, naturally want to get Alice this goddessBut this is too difficultThis time, it is an opportunity"Alice, Goddess?" Merritt's face was covered in a giggle of laughter, and immediately he raised his head and drunk the red wine in the glass.****** Nimitz sat on the carriage backThe brow is deeply wrinkledAlice is Karan's fiancee! If you let Alice go alone to meet with Merritt, it is undoubtedly to advance Alice into the fire.In the future, facing the question of Kalan, he will be betterHowever, if this matter is passed out, the impact on the Debus family will be great.“Oh, if the family is finished, what reputation!” Nimitz shook his head and sighedNow the Debus family has reached the most critical moment, once the Debus family is convicted of smuggling.The entire family will be exterminated, and the property will be completely taken away by the King of Klein.Although the Debuss family has left its roots outside the family, the family is not cut off.butAlmost all industries of the Debus family are in the kingdom of FinlayIn the event of failure, the Debuss family wants to recreate their glory, and they do not know what year to wait.Compared with the future of the family, it’s not a big deal.After all, how much time does the aristocrat's filthiness be less? "But this thingAlice must promise himselfNimitz was a bit worried. "I can't force Alice to right-handers.""Alice's innocenceNimitz did not care too muchA woman only! But Nimitz understood... "This Alice, after all, has a special relationship with lei.If I force AliceWas that linlai knewThen..." Nimitz was scared in his mindLei, a very special place in the Kingdom of FinlandAlthough Marquis was sealedHowever, LEI is actually a person of the Holy See. Even earlier, Clyde invited LEY to become a nobleman in the Kingdom of Finland.Also said that regardless of the monarchObviously, Clyde hopes to win over LinBecause the nobles of the Kingdom of Finland are all aware that, as long as lei is willing to, I am afraid that can easily become the worship of white rituals of the Holy See, and decades later, lei became a red cardinal is also very normalThe Archbishop of Redness is even higher than the king! "Can't forceNimitz had some headaches and Alice would not agreeHe thought about the problem from the perspective of lei landAlice is, after all, lei's first lover! If Nimitz forced Alice to go to Merritt, she lost her innocence.Lei is not mad! ****** Debus Family HouseIn the living room, there were a lot of people from the Debuss family. Alice and Rowling also stayed here.Their large group of people are waiting for Nimitz to returnThey are all worrying about the future of the Debuss family! "The uncle is back, and the uncle is back."A middle-aged man standing in the living room and looking forward to seeing Nimitz's presence immediately shoutedThe Debus family in the entire living room immediately greeted Nimz in the past.Alice looked at Rowling and immediately got up and went outside to meet her.“What happened to Uncle?” the middle-aged man immediately askedNimitz looked at a group of people in front of him and tried to squeeze a smile: "It's better now.Everybody goes back first, Alice, you stay, I still have things to talk to youNimitz was still very influential in the family. Hearing him, a group of people had to disperse one by one.Alice wondered why Nimitz had to talk to himself“Alice’s sister, then I’m going back to the house first.Rolin shook hands with Alice and whisperedJust a moment, the entire living room <div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Alice aloneNimitz enters the living room"What's the matter with Grandpa, Grandpa?" Alice said awkwardly.Nimitz looked at Alice and smiled first: "Alice, don't be nervousYou sit down first and we talk about itSaid Nimitz first sat downThe past was extremely serious. Not how couldn't I see her Nimitz. How can her attitude be so good today? Alice's heart is in doubt"You sitNimitz smiled very amiablyAlice sat slyly by the sideNimitz sighed with a low breath, and his eyebrows were full of hope: "Alice, you're just getting engaged to Carran, and it didn't happen to us that this happened to the Debuss family.I don’t know who secretly framed my Debus family. If I knew it, I would have killed him."Nimitz's face shows a hint of guilty, and immediately Veneton is helpless.""But now, the most important thing is to wash away the grievances of our Debuss family and save Bernard and Karan.Alice noddedOnly Alice was puzzled: "How did Grandpa talk to me about this?" Nimitz looked at Alice and said sincerely: "Alice, I have one thing for you.""beg me? Alice couldn't help standing upNimitz is among the Debuss family. Even the patriarchs are very respectful to Nimitz.Now that Nimitz actually said, "Seek her," Alice is not shocked.AliceThe case of the Debus family involved in the smuggling of this case was scrutinized by the right-hander, 'Merritt', who was very curious to you and wanted to talk to you alone.Nimitz immediately persuaded eagerly: "AliceThis is a rare opportunity to have a good relationship with Protesters.As long as the relationship with adult Merritt is done well, he will help us the Debus family, Alice. You grew up with Karan.You will never see him in prisonAlice was stunnedTalk alone? Alice is also regarded as living in aristocratic families. It is very clear that the aristocrats are filthy inside.She guessedMeeting with Merritt adults is definitely not easy"II..." Alice stutteredNimitz pleaded: "AliceOur Debuss family will see you, I can even guaranteeAs long as you can have a good relationship with Lord Merritt, you can be the right wife of Karan."Alice feels a little confused at this timeAlice is still very cleanWhether it is lei or kalan, she finally holds the last oneEven if engaged with Karan Blue, Alice is obliged to wait until the wedding before she will be in the same room.Now let her deal with Merritt... "Alice, even if I beg youNimitz gritted his teeth and straight down from his chair. He pleaded and said, "Alice, Karan's life and death depends on you."" Card blue life or death? Alice shockedKaran is a woman who grew up with her childhood. Especially in these days, the Debus family is often subject to rumors, and Karan has been protecting her."Okay, I promisedAlice said with a biteNimitz could not help but have a pleasant surprise on his face, and quickly said, "That's good. Then, tomorrow evening, I'll arrange for you to go to Melody."But Alice's face is pale at this moment, but she has not responded at all."****** The next eveningA carriage drove out of the Debus Houses under the guard of twelve knights and was slowly driving towards the House of Merit.And within the carriage, there was only Alice.Alice sat quietly in the carriage, licking her lips, clutching her tightly with her hands tightlyThe carriage continued to move forward and soon arrived at the entrance to the residence of the Duke of Merritt."Miss Alice, come"The voice of the driver was heard outsideAlice couldn't help but startled. Her right hand touched her waist. The hard daggers on the waist made Alice’s heart slightly set.Taking a deep breath, Alice pushed the car out of the carriage... House of the Duke of Merritt in the living roomWearing a long dress and wearing Alice’s coat on topStepping forward, Alice walked into the living room calmly, Alice looked around, and she was left empty in the living room."Er?"

Alice's slight mealBut at the urging of the waiter's gaze, Alice took a stepThe study is very remote and secludedEven the people here are extremely fewGoing to the door of the study, Alice saw a middle-aged man who looked like blond and he was walking at the desk and looking at some paper.“This is Merritt?” Alice saw Merritt’s first look and felt that Merritt was supposed to be a very skilled person.Even when sitting at the desk, the waist is straight, eyes are sharp“Duke of the Lord, Miss Alice is here"The maid respectfully saidMerritt only looked up at this time and saw Alice standing up immediately excitedly: "Haha, Miss Alice has come? I have waited for a long time, come, Miss Alice, please sit down first."Merritt stood up and walked towards Alice.Alice entered the studyAlice looked around and there was a bookshelf on the right side of the study. There were numerous books on it.And on the left side of the study is a bed“I usually read books or I’m tired of handling government affairs. I will rest here."Duke Merritt said with a smile, and walked to the door to close the study doorSeeing the door of the study room closed, only Mellitt and her two were left inside. Alice could not help but be surprised"Merritt, the door is still open.I'm not used to a dark environmentAlice said quickly
