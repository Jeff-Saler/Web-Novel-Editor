Yun Hao, Lin Lei’s request for this cloud is actually to refine the hemolytic poison powder, and the refining of hemolytic poison powder is precisely to deal with Clyde.This cloud can be, eventually turned out to be Clyde to himself"Is it true that there is a cycle of cause and effect?" At this time, lei could not help thinking about the teachings of the Holy See. The teachings of the Holy See have a message about destiny.In the past, lei did not believe in religion, but now it is a very strange development.Since the cloud can be sent to their own hands, they will not accept it? "Thank you for your timeLei said with a smile and said thanks, but also took this cloudLei is in the bottom of my heart is sneering: "since you gave it to me, it shows that God wants you to dieThen no wonder I"In the memory of lei, there is almost no mother's impression, but it does not hinder lei's thirst for maternal love.Since childhood, there was no mother and she made lei feel solitary. When she saw someone's mother, whenever she was uncomfortable, she would be alone and silently thinking about her mother.Grabbed this Clyde, forced to ask the mother's whereabouts! "LEI, I had a right meal at noon today, and you left me with lunch, how about?" Clyde smiled and looked at Lin."Yes, Your Majesty" lei attitude is very humbleThe queen next to Grace took a nod with lei and said softly to Clyde: "Your Majesty, you are here with the master lei, I will go back firstClyde also nodded indifferently, in the kingdom of Finlay.The power of the king is far more than the queenIn November, the weather is coldKelei and Clyde are still cool in their dress and they are not afraid of coolnessToday's lei is a seven-level warrior, and Clyde is a nine-level strongman."Your Majesty, what do you want to do with Merritt today?" lei chatted with Clyde.Clyde heard leiThere was a meaningful smile on the face, and the waitress and waiter on the side looked aside. The waitresses immediately retired one by one.Clyde whispered quietly: "LEI Lei, you know, Merritt recently married the thirteenth wife?" "The thirteenth?" LEI YiyiHe did not know that the right-handed adult who was serious in the Trial Court was so indiscriminate"His wife Xinyidi, but it is very delicious"Clyde smiles at lei, a man who understandsSee Clyde's expression, lei could not help but be surprised"Haha..." Clyde patted lei shoulder, "LeiWaiting for the New Year, you are all eighteen.Don't tell me, you haven't tasted woman yetLei couldn't help but somehowClyde sighed and said: “Myrtle’s kid, it’s amazing to find that fascinating goblin.But since I value it, that charming leprechaun is myMerritt didn't dare to move"This kind of thing, Clyde is also talking directly to lei."Your Majesty, this, is this okay?" lei was a bit surprisedAfter all, it was the lady of the right-hand side who listened to Clyde's intentions and actually took it directly."What's wrong, Merritt has its place todayIt's not up to women.He should understand his positionHowever, lei, if you had married Merit's wife's dinner that day, you didn't seem to go.Clyde doubtedDuring this time, lei has been thinking about prescriptions, thinking about medicinal herbs, which would also care about what feastGeneral noble feast, lei are all rejectedRight wedding banquet? Like to quit! "Lee, or else, today's lunch timeYou also look at Merritt's wife, Windsor.If you like, I don’t mind giving it to youI can guarantee that Merritt will not be able to touch Windsor again.Clyde confidently saidClydeAbsolute prestige in Kingdom of FinlayMerritt's wedding day, but Clyde caught sight of WindsorThat eveningClyde got Windsor into a house outside and Clyde enjoyed the nightAnd Meryl, still dared to have a little temperandFrom that day on, Merritt dared not touch Windsor.Some of the Ministers of the Kingdom of Finlay are seated on the official position by their own ability. They belong to the real minister.However, some ministers climbed up by means of some inexperienced people. Those ministers were also some of the guilty officials.Lei heart secretly surprised Clyde's hegemonyBut Cryde, who is called gold lion, has a lion's domineering in itself.Its overbearing behavior is also imaginable“Your Majesty, the Duke and the Duchess of Merit have arrived"A court waiter came to respect him"Haha, lei, goClyde stood up immediatelyLei can only start with the clouds and start with Clyde, but in a moment, they came to the royal palace in an elegant pale red courtyardAnd Merritt and the Lady Windsor have already waited in the courtyardLei could not help but look at this Mrs. Windsor Clyde temptedMrs. Windsor, with a graceful figure, though her body was worn tightly, but tightly trousers had completely drawn out the elegant long-legged curve. The waist was slightly tightened, but it was a bulging chest.The dark red hair is so sexyEspecially this Lady Windsor, that eye seems to beWhen you look at her, you can't help but think about it."Your Majesty, lei adultsWith Merritt, the gentle voice of the Windsor woman sounded"It's a leprechaun"Lin Lei underground channelClyde proudly took a look at lei, whispered in lei ear, said: "how? have a little impulse?"Let's go in for lunch"Lin Lei Shen Sheng said<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "Haha..." Clyde laughed.The Windsor couldn't help but scrutinize lei with his eyes. It seemed to be very interesting to lei.If there is no Merlet and Clyde present, I am afraid that Windsor will directly lining up"Wow, so beautiful woman"The beibei eyes that have been on the shoulders of lei suddenly suddenly rolled round."call out"Beibei even jumped, jumped directly to Windsor ... ... chest position"How big is it?"Bebe's voice rang in lei's headLei ran away"Cute mice"Winsor is holding Becky in excitementBabe also very much enjoys arching the arch with a small headPalace, today in the royal palace by the Windsor, often with that kind of ecstasy attention, lei also feel a bit difficultEnter the carriage"go backLei commanded the escort directly and the carriage started immediately."Boss, what do you rush to do? Yes, that Clyde didn't give you that Windsor.You accept it” Bebe Wu's small eyes staring at the leiLei could not help but take a look at babe's head: "you little mouse"" Well, my babe is almost readyBebe said with dissatisfactionLei can not laughBut think of your own harvest in the palace this time.Lin Lei still could not help but smileRemoved the next boxThere is a cloud in this box"Clouds have already arrived, and now all eight materials are sufficientI can already manufacture hemolytic poison powderLei has already decided that this time he will immediately begin to manufacture hemolytic poison powder"Big boss, I feel that Clyde is still very loyal, do you really want to kill?" Babe said in a low voiceLei brow wrinkled and glanced at babe"Bebe, Clyde is a king of the kingdom, as long as he has a little brainNaturally want to make friends with meHe is loyal to me and friendly to meJust because of my identity, my potentialIf I have no potentialThat Clyde might be too lazy to ignore meEven if I have a beautiful wife, he may directly snatch it.It's like that MerrittLei is very clear about ClydeThis person, Clyde, is actually a very ruthless person.But it should also be considered a relatively successful kingAt least the minister and the mediocre person, he still distinguished“I even suspected that when Clyde met my mother, she plundered her past."To see Windsor today, lei thought of this possibilityWith Clyde's character, this possibility does have"Bebe, you said I could put Clyde?" lei looked at babeThink of that possibilityLei heart can not help but gush endless killing meaningMay feel the lei's heart to clyde's killing, babe immediately said: "The kill to kill, my babe first hands-on” Bebe he stood up and constantly waving a pair of front claws and grinningTo LEI, he expressed his hatred of Clyde"You don't need to do it. When you ask about the status of your mother,I'm the first oneLei said coldlyIn the closet of the lei’s residence, illuminated by 18 candles, the entire secret room is bright.Lei is carefully refining the process of hemolytic poison powderHemolytic poison powderThe refining process is really complicated and every step must be careful, careful and carefulIf there is a mistake, the material will be wastedAt the moment, various instruments of alchemists were placed on the table of the secret chamber. Eight kinds of materials such as nebula were shredded and split into many pieces.“Lin Lei filtered out the concoction in the medicine jar and put it into another clean medicine jar.Continuing to use the fire, while lei carefully put the other three materials already weighing in"The order can not be disordered, it should be put into the blue heart grass, turmeric, HuayirenLei visualized the medicine pot, the whole person's spiritual power is highly concentrated, carefully watching the reaction inside the medicine tank, each step must be very accurateAll night passed"Finally finished a liquid medicineLei carefully filtered a small amount of transparent liquid in the canister and poured it on a white plate."This transparent liquid, with clear water, seems to make no differenceLei sighed in his heartAccording to the method of refining hemolytic poisonous powder, the last transparent liquid is actually considered to be hemolytic.But to dry it completely, the resulting hemolytic poison powder is the purest poison.In fact, this liquid has already been burned and the water is running out. It is estimated that within ten days, it will be enough to dry completely and become a hemolytic poison powder."The first success, the second one tomorrow night" lei is very carefulHe did not dare to do all of the materials at one time. After all, he would die if he made a mistake.Divide into multiple timesAt least one failure is not afraidA poison powder is almost enoughCan be in case, lei is still ready to do more than a few poison powder outMagnolia calendar end of November 9999The six hemolytic poison powders made by Lin Lei have finally dried completely.
