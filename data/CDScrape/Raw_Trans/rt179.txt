The first snow in winter is very big, and the thick snow in many places in the hinterland of the mountains of Warcraft can clearly see all kinds of footprints. There are humans and different sizes of Warcraft."Very big snowLei is still wearing that tattered linen trousers, humming the upper bodyEven if the temperature is cold enough to make the turbulent flow of water into ice, lei is not afraidBare feet, lei marched forward"Boss, it's time to get through Magnolia Festival nowBebe guessedLong stay in the mountains of Warcraft, even about the time to forget, although lei has a pocket watch, but that pocket watch is only a simple time, and no date"It should be aboutLei noddedInto the Mountain of Warcraft about two years, the two years the lion warrior strength growth rate is still relatively fast, reaching a peak of sevenHowever, in the use of epee, but it is better than just got the black-eyed epee, I do not know how muchEspecially when it becomes an eight-level double magician, magic and warrior abilities are used together, the strength is much higher."En?" lei and babe turned around and lookedI saw not only the two handsome men wearing leather armbands running fast and running, but seeing that it was human, lei went on again.There are a large number of masters in the Mountain of Warcraft year round to practice, in the past two years, lei has encountered many humansFor humans in the Mountain of Warcraft, lei is holding on to the principleAfter all, there are many of them, but the idea of ​​playing the magic crystal core wrapped in other peopleLei because there is a space ring, so there is no packageSo people who have played LEI’s ideas are still very few"Wait, wait.Anxious shouts came from behindLEI did not pay any attention and continued to walkThe speed of the two runners was still very fast, and they rushed inWhen they catch up, lei immediately stops to turn around"What are you going to do?" lei looked coldly at the two strong menTo lei's vision can determine the strength of these two people is not weak, but human strength is difficult to see from the outsideLei is still alert to these two people"We?" The two strong men took a look at each other, but they smiled at Lin Lei.One of the bald-headed men apologized and said: "We have no other meaning. It's just dangerous in the central area of ​​the Mountains of Warcraft. Our two brothers want to ... walk with you brothers.In this way, if you help each other, how safe is it? "Another bald man gave a glimpse and then nodded his head:"Central area is too dangerousLet's go together and help each otherIn this way, we all left the central area together and went out of the Mountain of Warcraft. We are separated again.""I am not interested"Lei Lei brow, turned and will continue to start aloneLei is not a fledgling boy in the past, he can see that these two men are obviously lyingIn the Warcraft Mountains, but also help each other? This is a jokeThese two people want to walk with themselvesIt must be bad intentionLei do not want to get into trouble, do not bother to kill these twoNaturally do not want to walk with themThe two bald men saw that lei just walked away and looked at each other, but hesitated for a moment and immediately chased it back."Wait, wait for this brother, please wait."Two bald men chased it againLei could not help but wrinkle his head and looked back to see the two people chasing it.The two dumbfoundedly looked at the lei, among them the one-eyed man even apologized and said: "I'm really sorry, but our two brothers really want to get along with you.You can rest assured that as long as you are out of here, our two brothers will definitely thank you very much for your help.Lei glanced at the two people"You have to follow itLei said indifferentIn the Warcraft Mountains so longLei has a lot of experienceThe two people have to follow them and let them follow. lei is confident to deal with these two people.Not to mention there is a babe on the shoulder of lei."thanks, thanks"The two bald men are gratefulImmediately the two of them stepped and followed him alongside him. From time to time, the two of them also looked around and looked at each other with a trace of fear in their eyes."This brother, we are in the southwestern province of O'Brien.Do not know brother you are? "The bald one-eyed man and the lei set almostLin Lei eyebrows a liftO'Brien Empire? Lei is very clearIf we now proceed directly to the east, we will be able to enter the territory of the O'Brien empire soon."What are you asking for so much?" lei glanced at the person. "You must follow, don't say anything."""Yes Yes"The bald one-eyed man noddedIn their opinion, lei is indeed an unusual person. It's not surprising that in the winter, it only wears a pair of trousers. But it's strange that this man is still so indifferent in the central region of the Mountain of Warcraft that it is so slow.It seems that this is the most dangerous placeIt's the same as his home garden"Brother"The bald man behind him pulled the leather arm of the bald one-eyed man and lowered the voice." Big Brother, do you say we can keep our life? "The bald one-eyed man looked at him in horror and pushed down the voice:" Don't think too much. Now follow this mysterious person first.Follow him, maybe we still have some hope""YepThe bald man nodded, but his heart was stillHowever, in front of the lei, she walked very calmly.Lei is also noted, but lei feelThese two people should not be the kind of people who want to start with themselvesAfter walking for a while, lei stoppedOne day LEI only walks about ten miles, while other times are in cultivation.Lei stopped, the latter two people are really anxious"How did you stop?" The bald one-eyed man rushed"lei?" lei glanced at him with dissatisfactionHis younger brother quickly accompanied the laugh and said: "Adult, here is still the central region.Are we going out of this dangerous place and rest? "<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> Lin Lei frowned and said: "You two people don't want to follow this person, but I want to leaveWant to stopIf you are noisy in this, don't blame me for killing you two"The two bald men looked at each other and then laughed."sorry SorryThe two men immediately retreated to one side and never dared to bother lei."These two people behave in a manner that is a bit weirdLei glanced at these two people, these two people said to leave the mountains of warcraft, but they have to follow their ownDo not leave, these two people did not even goWhy do you have to follow yourself? These two people do not know their ownLei sat down and kneesPull out the black halberd sword and put it on the legsAt this time, lei suddenly feel a burst of heart - "hey!" lei suddenly turned his head, a dark shadow that flashed from the front, and then disappeared"Ah, ah..." There was a cry of fear in the distance.Lei only noticed that the two bald men actually had only one left at the moment.The one-headed man left alone, as his brother has disappeared.There is a pool of blood in the snow"Ah, ah, no, no"The bald-headed man seems to have been stimulated like never beforeScreamedLei stood up solemnly, babe also alert up"Boss, that monster is so fast"Bebe's solemn voice," entered the mountains of Warcraft for so long, this is the fastest I foundI didn’t see it just now. I don’t know if it’s human or Warcraft.Lei did not see clearlyThe monster is too fast, even faster than babe's."What exactly is it? Bebe can now enter the 9th level of Warcraft, enter the Warcraft Mountains for so long, and also encountered a lot of Warcraft.But when it comes to speed alone, no one exceeds Bebe’s"lei heart suspiciousBebe's speed is the advantageNine World of Warcraft are hard to find in terms of speed over Babe's"What is that monster? Is it a Sanctuary of Warcraft?" lei was surprisedSacred World of Warcraft speed is naturally fast, faster than beibei normalLei immediately turned to look at the blind one-eyed manAt the moment, the bald one-eyed man's eyes are full of fear and his mouth keeps sayingWatch from time to time in horror.Seems afraid to be attacked again"what"The bald one-eyed man felt that he was caught suddenly and he could not help but cry out in horror."But when he came back to God, it turned out that lei grabbed his collar."Say, what's the matter?" lei stared at him"Otherwise, I will abandon you here alone, leave alone"" No, no, don't drop me"The bald one-eyed man actually went straight down," I said, I saidLei could not help but frownHe had already heard that the O'Brien Empire was the most powerful empire of military power and worshiped the god of war in the O'Brien empire.Many empire people practice cultivation as warriors, and powerful warriors are mostly proudThis bald man can enter the central area of ​​the Mountain of WarcraftStrength is not weakEven if it is not a 7th-level soldier, it is also a 6th-level soldier.But now, the bald-headed man in front of him even said that he was kneeling and he was kneeling down."Adults, you don't know. These days, it's just a nightmare."The bald one eye seems to have tears in the eyes of menLei immediately listened attentively"This time with my brother, my wifeThere are also some other brothers and friends who form a team to enter this world of Warcraft.At the same time also prepared to get some Warcraft crystal coreFor those of us who have entered the Warcraft Mountains five or six timesThis is normalBut did not expect ... "The bald one-eyed man shuddered." On entering the third day of the Warcraft Mountains, we just entered the middle-range area of ​​Warcraft and entered a nightmare."" I have a team of seven soldiers with six, and two six magiciansHunting in the mid-level Warcraft area is not dangerousBut who wants... we have met a terrible monster""monster? Lei brow crease"For the first time this monster was encountered, he attacked directly, just as I killed a good brother."The bald one-eyed man's body shook." We were very angry at that time because the monster was too fast. We didn't even find the figure of the monster. We just heard the screams of a friend to know that he had been attacked.And seeing the blood left on the ground, we understand that our friend may have died."At that time, we thought that the World of Warcraft would only attack, and even dared to deal with us, it was certainly not strong.Angrily, we still want to take revengeHowever, we did not find the monster at that time"The bald one-eyed man took a deep breath and calmed down his excitement and continued:" But on the evening of the day, when we had dinner, the monster came again."Speaking a man with a blind eye, he will be round and obviously very nervous.""The monster once again took away one of our magicians this time.Only this time, it just picked up the magician and picked it up to dozens of meters away.Just before our group of people, this monster eats the magician of our team.""monster? What does it look like? Lei immediately asked"Looking like a leopard with a body almost dark"The bald one-eyed man said"The body is dark? Eight World of Warcraft black leopard?" Speaking of this, lei also some do not believe, because an eight-level warcraft also can not reach just so amazing speedEven if Leopard World of Warcraft is the most amazing"It's not a black leopard. People in our team are also quite knowledgeable. We all know the black lines of the black leopard.However, the whole body of this monster is a curved black pattern, and the black pattern is very dense.”
