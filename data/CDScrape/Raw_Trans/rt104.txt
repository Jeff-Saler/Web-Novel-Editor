In the living room“I'm really sorry, Maya curatorLei humble said, "this stone carving I really do not want to auction, do not want to display, but I can guarantee that if I later want to sell this stone, or want to exhibit, will certainly ask you Prouks Hall to help of"Miaia Curator took a cane and smiled at lei:" Oh, don't mindWhen I come here, I would like to let your work go to our halls and exhibitions are secondary, and the most important thing is to meet the genius that we saw in the stone carving industry for millions of years."At this time, the hotel's director came in."The person in charge smiled apologetically for Maia’s chief curator, and then looked at Lin Lei and Yale: “Yale, Master Lin, a man and horse of the Rhine Empire came to the hotel and they wanted to meet with the youngest of the lei.""Haha"The director of Maia got up and smiled." It seems that you are very busy with lei now. Then I will not disturb you."Saying that the director of Maia left his room with his own handsLei looked at the hotel's official: "please help stop it, I don't want to see people in the four empire and dark league nowLei very simply rejected everything to attract himLei is very clear that if he meets with the four empires or dark alliances, it may cause strong dissatisfaction on the part of the Holy See.After all, once they meet, even if they did not respondAfter all, the people of the Holy See are not on the scene. They naturally doubt it.Moreover, the power of the party of the Holy See is also very strong in the entire Magnolia continent and is not weaker than any other empire.Lei does not necessarily need to join other empires or dark alliances****** Three days later, in the carriage to the city of Finlay, there were only Linley and Yale among the carriages. Renault and George both stayed in the college."The thirdYou are indeed wise, and there are even people in the four great empire and dark league who want to meet you on these two or three days."Yale said with a smile, to meet with lei, are the four empire and the dark alliance in the sacred league some of the affairs of the person in chargeThose characters are not big names. After all, seventeen-year-old seven-level double-lined magicians, the news will have to reach the four major empires and the dark alliance, or it will take a long time.After all, they are too far away from each otherThose in charge of other forces in the Holy AllianceI also made a decision to see lei.Unfortunately, they were all rejected by lei"Yale, I have a collection of my Baruch family inheritance treasures, called the Lucas family, if I want to return to their swords from their hands, 'slaughter', really difficult?" lei this time headed to Finlay City, it is for this matterYale nodded. "Yes, I started to anxiously tell you that I didn't pay much attention to this family.It now appears that this Lucas family is not ordinary.Lei nodded slightlyHundreds of years ago, they collected the treasures of their own family.At least shows that this family is not a new family“The Lucas family is also a relatively old family with a history of almost a thousand years.Although the wealth in the Kingdom of Finland is only average, the influence of the aristocracy is very large.The most important thing is... The patriarch of the Lucas family is a very stubborn old guy, and he likes to be favorite.The inherited treasure of your family, but the first dragon blood warrior's personal weaponAlthough the Dragon Blood Warrior has not appeared for over a thousand years, this weapon is of great significance after all, and the value of this weapon of your family is at least hundreds of thousands of gold coins at the very least."" Even though there are gold coins, I'm afraid it is difficult to get a hand with the stubbornness of the Lucas family patriarch.Yale sighedsome peopleNot just a gold coin is useful"LEI, if I let my uncle help out, use the network of our chamber of commerce.To give that old stubbornness a little pressure, the difficulty of this matter is not greatYale proposedLei knew yeah is a good intention, but lei really does not like to help others"I'll try it first. If I can't, then please Yale boss for your help.Lei said with a smileSuddenly lei felt a commotion beside **, then Bebe’s little body emerged from the sideBabe opened his eyes and looked at YaleThen look to leiAt the same time, the soul exchanged: “The boss, this carriage is slowI have slept, how haven't I been to the City of FinlayLei picked up babe: "Well, do not make trouble, after a while it should be"Suddenly-"Ah! "Sound screams, the carriage stopped suddenlySitting in the carriage, lei and Yale also felt the carriage swing. Yale changed his face: "Not good."" Please also ask Lin Lei and Yale to come out first"There was a slightly harsh sound outside."Lei and yalu both looked at each other and the other person could trap them without them being aware of it. The strength was much better than them. They also went out from the carriage without much resistance.The carriage, the lei and Yale's faces are a change.At that moment, the two Seventh Class guards had already fallen from the ground and blood flowed to the ground.Even the groom had fallen.Seventh-grade fighters were killed without any resistance. The strength of the other side was obvious."Yale, lei two young masters, we have no maliceWe just want to invite lei to our seatAs for Yale, we naturally will not hurt you."At the moment, not far away, three Tsing Yi men are standing, and a knife man headed by him is opening up.Seven soldiers died in the ground, but Yale was angry but not attackedAfter all, he recognized the gap between each other's strength.Knife man smiled and looked at lei: "lei, you do not resist, you can easily catch you under the name of the master, let alone meWhat you have to do now is follow us with you. Do you not know that you are willing? Or let us use strong? "<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Lee looked at Yale next door, lei really do not want to suffer YaleThe youngest, don't go with themYale eagerlyLei knew in his heart that these three mightiers are not dark alliances, they are one of the four major empire, and they have strength in each other.I'm afraid it's hard to be pleased with ‘bebe’’What's more, the other person is looking for himself and definitely wants to join them, at least not to harm himself."Okay, I'm going with youLei noddedThe man with a knife could not help laughing: "This is all right, Lord Yale, I hope you forget what happened just now.The two men who said the knife-smashed man turned to the side made a colorThe two Tsing Yi men quickly found their way to lei's side"Let’s go"The knife man spoke- Lin Lei will be holding Beibei, under the support of two Tsing Yi men, began to move toward the southeast"I don't want to kill the two guys. The two guys next to you, I have a good chance of killing them. But I didn't know if I had a knife.” Bebe’s soul voice saidLei know that babe's perception is very accurateAnd he also inferred that the two next to him are probably eight-level fighters.And the man who is the head of the sword is likely to be the nine strongestBeing able to mobilize a nine-level strongman and two eight-level strongmen is not something that ordinary forces can afford."Bebe, don't be impulsiveLei stopped the road"How is the master now so much?" lei heart helplessDerlin Kewater appeared next to him. He smiled and looked at Lin: "You are now in a different position. The contact master is naturally different. I told you long ago that in the Magnolia continent, it would be seven. Step into the forest of the strongIn any of the four empire's empire, the sanctuary may be very few, but there are still dozens of nine strongmen.It's nothing to send you one"An empire, or an alliance, is hundreds of millions of peopleAmong the hundreds of millions of people, there are only dozens of nine-level strongmen, and among them, there are only nine-strong ones among almost ten million.In fact, nine strong is still extremely rare and rare "what are they going to now?" lei doubted to ask Delinquwater"If I'm goodThe trio should be from the Dark Alliance, the Dark Holy See.They should now want to enter the World of Warcraft Mountains first, and then go directly to the South inside the Mountain of Warcraft.Go to the Dark League area"Drinkingwater replied confidentlyLei thought and agreedThe four great empires and the two major leagues have garrisoned troops, but there are no troops stationed in the Mountain of Warcraft.After all, for those World of Warcraft, the general army is simply food.The Mountain of Warcraft is a fierce place for ordinary fighters.For a class nine strongFor two tier eight powerhouses, it is simply a straight wayAs long as the three people do not enter the core area of ​​the Mountain Range, there will be no danger****** Where the fighting just happenedYale looked at three people who diedWith a sigh, he went on foot to the city of Finlay. He just leftA man in black suddenly appeared in his place. The black man took a glance at the direction of lei being taken away and immediately removed a special black clarinet from his arms.The voice of the squeaky, groaning sound from the clarinet was very weird. If there were four people standing in the four directions of the clarinet, the voice of the man standing in the direction of the city of Finlay was more than a The voice of the opposing party is a thousand times biggerThis clarinet, which binds almost all sound waves in one direction, does not depend on sounds, but depends on a special kind of vibration....... lei holding babe, very clever follow the three people all the way forward, this knife is also very satisfied with the lei men withBut when they were two or three miles away from the Mountain of Warcraft, the man's face changed."call"The knife-knock man retired to lei almost instantly, and then he looked around," come out"Suddenly, six men in tight-fitting blacks appeared. The six black men appeared and the knife-wrought man did not care. His eyes were locked in the distance. He saw a man in black robes and a man in linen. The old man came from afar"LEI is a person of our sacred alliance. We, the people of our sacred alliance, you, the Dark Vatican's 'arbiter,' dared to snatch it. Isn't it too much to put our eyes on the bright church?" CryingThe Skull man smiled: "I did not expect that he even provoked the vice referee you personally, oh, also invited a ‘plumbearer’ to come over, and the ‘deacon’s of the refereesIt seems that you really value this lei."The knife man knows the other person's strength, but he doesn't worry about it."I just want to ask lei to go to our dark league and play it. Since you all block it, it's OK."Sword man looked at the man in black robe," said the deputy referee, I want you to say a word, I let lei, you put me and my two men, how? The old man in the black robe is very clear. The man in front of this sword is the ‘arbiter’ of the Dark Holy See. The strength is strong. Even if he is to kill himself, it’s very difficult.But this time, I asked a sitter from the temple to come and it was not hard to kill him.But... lei is still on the other hand"Well, I guarantee with my honor that you and your two men can go, but you must leave leiThe old man in black robes didn't want to kill one another."Okay, I leave"The knife-knock man went straight away, and he greeted lei enthusiastically:" lei, if there is a chance in the future, you can go to our dark league at any time.Haha... Our dark league always welcomes you"Speaking, the man with a knife suddenly accelerated with his two men, and he left three phantoms, and the three disappeared.
