See the seven-level Warcraft "Raptor" and the mysterious magician left, this is only a relief in the heart of Hogg"Uncle HirleyHogg turned directly to the steward “Hiri”. “You immediately arranged some people to find out the gold that was melted by some of the ashes. This mercenary squad is not ordinary. It’s estimated that the money is also quite good.”Hope to make up for the loss of our town in WushanHogg looked around, and all the houses were transformed into ruins."Yes, adultsShiri noddedHillmanHogg looked at Hillman next to him and smiled. "How is it?" Hillman also nodded. "A little scary, ah, see the seven-level Warcraft "raptor" and the mysterious magic. The division, I knew that we had no ability to resist the Wushan town. Like a magician with a lofty status like the eighth-level magician, it was a town that destroyed our town on a whim. I am afraid that no one would criticize the master of magic. Don't say punishmentMagician, status is extremely loftyOrdinary magician, the status will catch up with the nobilityAnd the eighth-level magician is to see the king of a kingdom.This shows that the status of the eighth magician respected"That's right, so we are fortunate that at least people in Wushan Town have died.Hogg said with a smile"It is fortunate thatHillman also nodded"Silman, you bring someone here to assist Uncle Heath, and properly settle the problem of the civilians who have lost their place.Hoggart Road"Yes, Lord Hogg.Hillman shouldHogg looked back and looked at Hillman, wondering: "Well, lei? It was still there."I don't know, I didn't pay attention."Hillman also shook his head"Adult, young lei has gone backSiri, next to him, said aloud, "However, when the young master just left, he was a little absent-minded and he didn't know what he was thinking.Hogger nodded thoughtfully******* The Baruch family office is very small, and there are not many other houses. It is a special house. At the time when the Baruch family lived hundreds of times during the most prosperous time, people living in the houses nowadays had to be few. manyLian Lilei’s eight-year-old child also occupies a house aloneLei's bedroomAt this moment, Lin Lei is sitting alone on the bed and frowning.The horror scene of the “Fire Snake Dance” is constantly appearing in the mind. Seven dozens of fire serpents full of water tanks are vacated. The fire waves sweep the sky.Then suddenly there was a sea of ​​flames. The powerful warriors and magicians of the mercenary squad were turned into ash for only a while."Magi, it's so strong.Lei has a hint of turbulence in her heart. "Although I have the blood of dragon blood warriors, but the blood concentration is relatively low, the blood of Dragon Blood Warriors also contradicts other grudge codes. This point has limited the growth limits on the road of my warriors!" Do not know, I have no possibility of becoming a magicianLei suddenly wanted to be a magician"That Raptor is also terrifying. If I have a Raptor, that's what the Raptor's scene recalls in his mind."The lightning-like dragon's tail can smash the boulders at random and destroy the house.The huge body is like a giant collision tank in the army. Once it is quickly bumped, it is absolutely terrible to use the Raptor's shape and body's hard scales."World of Warcraft, do not know how to get a World of WarcraftLei heart also desires a World of Warcraft<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>I don't know how it is, lying in bed, lei can't sleep anywayGoing back and forth on the bed, some of the minds are the huge "raptors" and the mysterious magician who casts the "spirit of fire" scene."LEI, what's wrong?" A familiar voice soundedLei climbed up and looked up, it was his own father Hogg, at the moment Hogg is smiling and watching lei"fatherLei shouted respectfully, suddenly le feeling puzzled, "my father smiled at me? still this expression?" Hogg treats lei is very harsh, and rarely lei smiles kindly, especially the expression at this moment, Even more surprised lei"Not badHogg looked graciously at the lei. "It is worth noting that we are the men of the Dragon Blood Warrior family. We have the best qualities of the warriors. If the descendants of the Dragon Blood Warriors are afraid of life and death and fear blood killing, then it is really ridiculous."Lei understood at a glance that what his father said was that he saw Raptor alive and crunching the bloody scene of Luke but was not deterred.Lei was a bit surprised: "Father, have you seen?" "The speed of the raptor is so great. How could I not feel it? The raptor just came to our town in Wushan and I came out, but I was in another direction.Your performance with Hillman, I see a clear pictureHogg noddedLei laughedAt that time, in addition to being appalled at the very beginning, I felt excited afterwards and there was a kind of bloodthirsty fighting impulse.Lei is also suspected because of the blood of dragon blood warriorsHogg laughed and said: "LEI, isn't it a shock to you today? It's shocking to let you forget about dinner?" "Dinner?"“咕噜~~~” At this time, Lin Lei’s belly rang, and lei remembered this and went to the evening training. He hadn’t started yet and encountered “raptor” and mysterious magician’s things.According to reason, you should have dinner at the backOnly in Lin Lei's mind is the "spirit of fire" that shocks the soul. They are all "rapid dragons"."Father, I would like to ask if there is any possibility that the descendants of our Dragon Blood Warrior family will become magicians?" Lin Lei's hands gripped the bed sheet and stared at his father's eyes.When Hogg was surprised, he immediately realized that his son wanted to be a magician."possibleHogg noddedLin Lei could not help but have a happy eyeHogg waved his hand and let lei calm down. Then he said, "Lee Lei, we have seen magicians in the history of the Dragon Blood Warrior family.Lei, you should know that the magician is very valuedOf the ten thousand people in general, only one chance to become a magician is only one ten-thousandth.So don’t you expect too muchLei shook his head"Father, there is a glimmer of hope. I will fight for it.Lei face is more seriousHogg looked at the solemn expression of his eight-year-old son, and reasoned that a child’s serious expression was funny, but now Hogg's laughedHogg mused for a moment and said: "LEI, every year during the military season, that is, in the late autumn, there is a magical student's test in Wangdu's "Finlay City". If you really want to go, wait for this year's late autumn, Try it"When it was late autumn? Not only half a year?" Lin Lei was excited in his eyes.
