Lei's mind deeply remembered that sceneIn the face of Hitsey's inquiry, lei nodded. "It's very charming. I just remembered that scene.Only, I think I carved the level of stone carving, I am afraid it is difficult to achieve the level of wake up"The birth of a god is very difficult.The original lei was so sad that all emotions were integrated into it, everything was forgotten and the most mysterious state was finally completed.Now carving for carving, it is almost impossible to achieve that level."As long as you are a lion master you carved out, you're on the lineI don't seek to achieve the level of awakening. It would be sufficient to be able to reach the level of a master.Shise said with a smileLei noddedIf so, lei has a full grasp"Mr. Xisse, in this way, the stone carving that you requested will be taken in a month. How is it?" lei actually only needs three days to be enough, but lei is also to make him have enough spare time.Xisse nodded and said, "Well, one month, it's very short. I'm not in a hurry. I have time.Haha"" Master lei, what are you doing, though, if I can do it, I will give it to you?"Said SeasayLei can not help but feel nervousNow that Padson has been killed by him, the only goal in lei's mind is Clyde.To kill or catch ClydeNeither is what lei can do nowKing Xisse, the King of Killing, can definitely do it! "Mr. Geisel, if I ask you to help me with a king in the holy alliance, do you agree?" lei resisted impulse, first probeWith a glance, Xisse looked up to lei with alarm. "Catch a king?"Lei focus on the firstXisai brows wrinkledShen Yu looked at Lin Lei for a moment and said, "In this way, I want to ask you, if I can catch the king for youWill you kill him? ""should be! Lei replied honestlyIt is very unwise to deceive a king of killingAs for the killing of Clyde, if his mother was really killed by him, how could lei not take revenge? Lei heart is also some premonition, the mother is not so many years of audioTen ** has died, or is bound to somewhereIn either case, he must avenge his mother"Kill a king?" Sissy looked at leiLei looks forward to looking at seaShisse is very clearAlthough on the position, the Archbishop of Red is a little taller than the king of a kingdom, but the influence of killing the king is higher than the archbishop of Red.The Red Cardinal died and the Holy See can be replaced immediatelyBut a king died, I am afraid that within a kingdom will take placeAt the same time, the Holy See will also be dissatisfied with him because of this."I ask you, I forgive this request."Xixe solemnly looked at lei," lei, killing a king, too influentialAnd the bright church has a very good attitude towards meI do not want to make the Shinto Vatican stand against my army knife organization because of a stone carving."The king of the killings, Shisse, is behind the sword of one of the four major killers.Xisse, knowing how importantA stone carving, it is not worth his crack in a friendly relationship with the Holy See.In these years, the honorable courtesy of the Holy See is clear to him.He is not a white-eyed wolf. People treat him so courteously. He also starts with the king of other sacred alliances."Please change it."Sisse sorry for thisLei heart burst of powerClyde’s strength may not have been placed on his mind, but Clyde’s status makes it impossible for Hitsay to take action.Lei tries to calm herself“Mister Seaside, I would like to ask if there is any wayLet me have a seven magician and kill a nine strongLei inquiredXisai saw lei at a glanceShen Yu moments: "I have a lot of methods for killing people.But let a seven-level magician kill a nine-level strongman.It's a bit difficult"Speaking, he thought constantly in his mind.This murderous king who has not been killed for a long time flashed a kind of killing method in his mind.Lei dare not disturb Sisy's thinking, waiting quietly asideSuddenly, Greeks turned to look at LEI: "You said that the 9th-level strong is a magician or a warrior. If it is a magician, I do have a solution.""warriorLei immediately answeredDealing with fighters and magicians is completely different means of assassinationHearing that LEI was a 9th-level soldier, Xisse could not help but get a headache.Lei can only wait anxiously aside"Ah, I thought of one"Hisse eyes suddenly looked to lei." Haha, I was just a method that I accidentally remembered. I didn't expect 800 years to pass. I still remember.""any solution! Lei heart excitedGod! Did not expect the killing of the king, actually there really are ways for the seven magicians to kill nine powerful.“The king of killings has the most assassinations. I know more than I do, but if I live more than 5,000 years, I’m afraid I know more than he."Drincowwater's voice sounded in the mind of LinLei smile, delin grandfather always refused"The method is ... ..." Seaside smiled and looked to lei, "poison!" "use poison?" lei surprised a moment, he thought it was a good way, a king's diet, etc., all will be checkedWith drug abuse will be so simple? "Master lei, don't use drugsThe use of poison is a very profound art of assassination. There are numerous materials in the world.There are thousands of poisons, who dares to say that he knows all the poisons in the world? Can he detect all poisons? Lei could not help but nodThis point he believes, for example, Drincowort knows that blue-sweetheart can neutralize dragon blood to overbearing<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "I'm talking about this poisonIs dedicated to fightersAs long as it does not reach the sanctuary, this poison will be lost.In addition to this poison, there is no antidote so far. It takes only one and a half years to slowly consume this poison with grudges."Xixe is clearly aware of this poison," and this poison is colorless and tasteless. There is no way to detect it yet. Only in the middle.Will find myself in this poison"No ten? Can not detect? lei eyesThat Clyde was only a nine-level powerhouse. Once this poison was used, it was not his own ability to use his current strength. "This poison, Mr. Seaside?" lei askedLei guessed that this poison is certainly very preciousI don't need to think about this kind of problem, it has an effect on all the warriors in the sanctuary, and it is colorless and odorless. It has not been detected so far.So poison, if not preciousSoldiers in the world must die"Master lei, you didn't hear me saying just now. I remembered it arbitrarily 800 years ago. I just briefly looked at the poison drug prescription. After all, it didn't threaten me. I didn't care.Shissé said with a frown. "I only knew that the poison was written on the poison and consisted of eight materials."As for which eight kinds, I'm not sure"" Not sure? Lei is anxious to killXisai laughed and looked at Lin: "Master lei, don't worry, I don't knowBut this prescriptionAs early as in our organization base, there are collections. I can send someone to copy the copy of the prescription.However, the base of our army knife organization is in sparsely populated areas.Estimated time of one or two months"For a month or two, I can't wait! lei nodded to Xisse: "Mr. Gessai, you don't know if there is any ready-made poison in your organization?" Lei can not want to waste time looking for a variety of materials to match poisons"we do not have"Hisse shook his head and said, "In this world, I am afraid that only the hands of Death will organize""The hand of death? "When lei chatted with Yale in the past, Yale talked about the four major killer organizations, namely - the sword of the Red Crescent Death.Every killer organization has its own particularitiesAmong them, the hand of death is known by various special strange killers.“Yes, if it wasn’t for the hands of God to ask me, I’m afraid I’ll be willing to organize this extremely valuable prescription for us.Xisse noddedBelow the holy domain, you can almost loreWith such poison, preciousness can be imagined"Well, I can't buy this poison for the hands of Death?" lei hopes"impossibleShissé laughed. "The top ten poisons of Death's hand were never given to other organizations. They gave me this poison prescription and they also guessed that we would not go with this poison.""" Will not go with? Lei puzzled look to sea"Because the price is too highnot worth itShissé laughed. "Especially two of these rare materials have long been monopolized by the hands of Death, and the money spent with a poison is probably more than a commission."Lei stunnedHowever, for lei, spending more money will not care"Then, I will go back now and arrange for people to bring that prescription to you.However, lei master, one month later, you can give me stone ohShisai said with a smile to lei"It is certainLei heart relaxedDeparted from Greece, long-term distressed how to deal with Clyde's lei finally assured that he also had a sweet dream that nightThe next afternoonLei is safely sitting cross-legged on the grass, practicing dragon blood grudgeThe body of green and black dragon blood is constantly buzzing. The unique energy of dragon's blood is constantly integrated into the bones, meridians, and deep muscles of the lei, which makes lei's physique improve slowly.Lei believes that so continue, one day, lei's body is enough to catch the sanctuary dragons, to reproduce the glory of the dragon blood warrior"Lei adults"The outside maid voice soundedLei took a deep breath, dragon blood vindictive return to the middle of Dantian"Come inLei said indifferentlyAt this time the maid came in, respectfully said: "Lin lei, debus family has several guests outside the door, said to thank lei adults""thank? "Leaton mealInstantly, LEI understood that Clyde gave himself a face and put the Debus family's card blue."Thanks? I'm afraid it's not just thanksLei heart tunnelThe people of the Debuss family had met with lei to help him.
