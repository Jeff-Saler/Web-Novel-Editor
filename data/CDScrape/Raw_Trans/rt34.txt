"Dragon Blood Code?" lei looked up in shock to his fatherHoggaard smiled and said: "It is not just the Dragon Blood Code. This book records many things related to our Baruch family. Among them is the "Dragon Blood Seal", which has a method for making blood clots. Some family ancestors' deeds, etc.Lei read it carefullySure enough, the first quarter of this book is about the "Dragon Blood Code," and the last three quarters are all about the family's other things."LEI Lei, this book is also useless to outsiders. It is impossible for others to practice. As for some things in the family, what is the use of others? So don't worry too much.And there are several copies within the familyIn fact, this is a copy of youAs for the original time, it has long since become ashes.Hogg said with a smileLei suddenly laughed"Yes, it doesn't matter if someone else gets it.” lei immediately curious to start reading the contents of the beginning of the Dragon Blood CodeThe first chapter of the "Dragon Blood Dense Code", "If you want to cultivate the "Dragon Blood Dense Code," you must mobilize the blood of the Dragon Blood Warrior in your body. There are two ways to inspire the blood of the Dragon Blood Warrior in your body. First, the blood concentration of the Dragon Blood Warrior reaches a certain level.If the Dragon Blood Warrior's blood concentration is not enough, there is a second way ..." See this, lei yiyiIn addition to the Dragon Blood Warrior blood concentration to a certain extent, there are other ways? How did the family succeed for so many years? "The second way is to take drunk dragon blood, or dragon blood that has just died within a few minutes. The time of death is slightly longer. The dragon blood effect is very weak! The drunk dragon blood can trigger lurking inside the body. Dragon Blood Warrior BloodIt is best to drink the blood of the sanctuary dragon, the best effectIf it is the Blood of the 9th-level Warcraft Dragon, it is less likely to trigger Dragon Blood Warriors.Lei saw this, it was shocked"Family ancestors are really powerful enough to cultivate the "Dragon Blood Seal Code."Lei laughed"Drinking live dragon blood, but also the sanctuary level lei, ah, the ancestors of your family is really powerful ah“Drincowwater was also present beside lei at the moment and he was surprised when he saw the first paragraph of the “Dragon Blood Code.”Hogg at the moment could not find Delin Kewot. Hogg smiled at Lin Lei: "LEI, see it.In fact, according to the ancestors, the blood of Dragon Blood Warriors is lurking in the depths of our blood, and it is necessary to inspire the blood of Dragon Blood Warriors in the body. Only these two methodsHowever, this second method, to drink live dragon blood, is it easy? And... lei, you look to the oppositeLei turned to see"However, the second way to drink live dragon blood is very dangerousDragon blood is extremely overbearing, and at the same time it has the effect of improving the physical quality. Dragon blood poured on the body can make the body physique improve dramatically.But it also makes people feel as painful as peelingThis is just watering the body surface. If you drink into the body, it will be like being burned by the fire. It will even be burned alive, blood vessels will burst, and you will lose your life on the spot."See this paragraph, lei really have nothing to say"Father, who wrote this book of dragon blood? Since it was dangerous, he wrote it." lei do not know what to say this timeHogge said: "Lin Lei, the "Dragon Blood Code," is the founder of our family. It was written by the entire first generation of dragon blood warriors in mainland China, "Balluk".Since he wrote it, there must be his truth.Even in the family history, two children devoured the sacred dragon blood, and finally the blood vessels ruptured and died on the spot."" In the history, people have drunk lived dragon blood? Lei surprisedIn fact, it is normal to want to comeThe patriarchs of the first, second, and third generations of the family were dragon warriors. At that time, the Baruch family was very beautiful.It was not impossible at that time to get a sanctuary dragon for bloodletting.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "The things that happened that year were too far away. The real secrets are not detailed in this book.I only know that because of this incident, the dragons have talked with our Baruch family.But since then no one has tried it... Waiting for the family to decline, and want to drink dragon blood, there is no chanceHogg said with a sighLei noddedThe dragons are proud and they are recorded in most books.Live sacred dragons for bloodletting, how much humiliation this is for the dragonsThe Baruch family was not lucky enough to be exterminated by the raging dragons.However, it is also conceivable that the Baruch family was strong."No, father.Since no one had been able to become a bloodthirsty warrior by swallowing dragon blood, why did the ancestors still write this secret code and said that they could drink live dragon blood for cultivation?Also said that nine dragons have some effects of Warcraft? Lei really puzzledHogge"lei, don't ask anymoreIn fact, for the history of the family, I also learned about this book.As for what happened exactly 4-5 years ago, we cannot figure it out.Hogg said to leiLei noddedKe Lin still has doubts in his heart, since the book records no one relying on sobbing dragon blood to succeed, why is the "Dragon Blood Code" also recorded this method? "LEI, it's late, so today you go back and rest.Hogg said with a smileLei noddedNightLei returned to his bedroom, holding this book in his hand, but still wondering"Grandpa Delin, you said, no one succeeded by this method. How could this method be discovered?" lei could not understand this problem.Drincowott, but the old is fine, immediately with a white beard, said: " lei, this problem is very simpleAs far as I know, the dragons are very proud and the dragons are very, very powerful! I estimate that drinking dragon blood cultivation should be effective. Your family should be under pressure from the dragons, so some of the contents of this book have been tampered with." lei suddenly understandThis is very likelyForced by the pressure of the dragons, the Dragon Blood Warrior of the Baruch family can no longer catch dragons to drink blood."Of course, this is just my guess"Drinkingwater laughed indifferently." And lei, as far as I know, this is not a dead end because it is a blessing to live dragon blood, as long as it is taken with ‘blue heart grass’It can counteract the damage of dragon blood, but this secret formula is now estimated to be unknown to no one.Lei leiThen there is ecstasy: “Grandpa Delrin, you said, it's safe to drink live dragon blood with bluegrass?” Delrinkwater confidently nodded and said: “That was of course when the Pu'ang Empire was first The princess was seriously ill and finally he was cured with live dragon blood and blue hearts.And that time, it was a sanctuary-level dragon that I grabbed."I remember that the court and old physician who provided this recipe once said that everything in the world falls by one thing. No matter what material, there are other materials that can neutralize it. And this recipe was also the court that year." The old doctor knew with me, but now that six thousand years have passed, it is estimated that few people know it."Drincowwater said indifferentlyLei nodded"Live dragon blood, blue heart grass ..." lei eyes shining with excitement, "wait for me after the strength to reach nine magic level even higher, with live dragon blood, blue heart grass let small wharton become Dragon Blood WarriorLei even wanted to ... wait until he had the opportunity to take it himselfIf you can become a holy magician in the future, you are a dragon warrior.Of course that's just a dreamFirst, catching a dragon in a holy land is an unattainable dream."The road is still growingSleep, sleep, and continue to exercise tomorrow morning”
