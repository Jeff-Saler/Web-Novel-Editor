Linke Water had nothing to say about lei's query"LEI, I tell you, if you add a bit of black halberd to a weapon, the hardness of this weapon will rise to a very high level.If a weapon is made entirely of black wolfberryYou are given to Sacred Masters and Sacred Masters cannot destroy it."Drincowwater is really helplessLei is obviously not fully aware of the precious black wolfberry"That, Grandpa Delin, can I use this black temper to make an 'episode'?" Since listening to Dill Cowater's last time talking about the benefits of 'Epee', lei just wanted to get a handle. swordOriginal lei ready to buy a good epee usedBut now this ‘black chert’ has naturally been usedToday's lei, there is no shortage of money at all"Is refining with obsidian? The size of an epee is relatively large and should be combined with obsidian and other ore materials.Of course, I don’t know about the mixerHowever, I have heard that using black obsidian for making weapons is not a simple matter.Obsidian is too hard. To melt it, the general master can not do it."Drinkovt said with a smileLei secretly nodded his headObsidian, that's a material that is hard to destroy even a god-class master, but since obsidian can be made into a weapon, there must be a refining method.It's just that this method is too difficult"I knowLei nodded*** The two princes and the prince Shaker continued marching toward the north. The more northward the World of Warcraft, the less, especially today, the lei has a group of people who have gone three or four hundred miles, but this Three or four hundred miles did not even appear as a World of Warcraft. Some of the cities and villages here are not dead.However, many people in cities and villages are scarce. It is estimated that many people are worried about danger.All migrated northwards"Haha, okay, this Hessian kingdom has not lostShaq laughed and said, "It's been all gone for a few days, so I can finally rest and rest.Shaq said, looking to leiLei sitting on the horse, sitting as if it were old trees, not rocking, the whole person is very stableLei faceless indifference, but also naturally have a calm temperamentFor leiShaq is a bit of aweAlthough he is a few years older than leiHowever, he always respectfully described lei as the lei adults."I'm an adult lei, see, the camp is in front of me.Shak and lei ride side by sideLei noddedThis bright church apparently decided to set a defensive line at the border of the Kingdom of Hess. From the endless military camp position, you will know how many soldiers there are."Two Kingdoms, Five PrincipalitiesAlmost a third of the sacred league territoryBelieve that the Holy See is not willing to regressLei said with a chuckle, lei when a pedestrian enters the level, it is easy to releaseThis level is to be careful of the Warcraft group.For humansIt doesn’t block it"Two princes, where do we stop?" lei surface is very calm“Hess City, one of the sites that my father and I set down. There are more than three hundred miles from Hess City. If you hurry up, you can arrive in the evening.Shaq replied without reservation"Hess City!" lei remembered the name of the heart, "clyde, Hess is your place of death"... ... all the way to the road, lei, shak and more than 30 people drove on the horse, leaving a dust on the roadWhen the crowds of lei and shak saw Hess City, the sun had not completely set.The light of the setting sun shines on the earth, and the earth shines through the earth.“Hess City, the king of the Kingdom of Hess, is only slightly smaller than the city of Finlay.Lei looked at the huge city wall of Hess City, the heart is shockingCan build such a huge cityHow much manpower and material resources will it cost? "Hilul Law ~~" A group of people were stopped at the gate of Hess City."dismount"Hess City defender shouted loudly"Why dismount?" Shaq yelledWhen the city guards saw Shaq’s group of people as having a very unusual origin, they replied, “There is a commandment in the temple, and it is not possible to ride horses in Hess.You are now full of people in Hess CityThere are not enough places for horse riding at all. You are still good at dismounting"" Dismount itLei said with a smile on shakShaq noddedLei and shak and others also imagined that I am afraid that many people fled from the two kingdoms, the five principal countries fled, and people near Hess City, many people fled to Hess City.The population of the two major kingdoms and the five major countries is hundreds of millions.Even if it is 99% dead, there are still millions of people living.What’s more, there’s almost no Warcraft in the hundreds of miles near the Kingdom of Hess.Most of the residents there did not die"Many people"Stepping into Hess City, lei, shak, and others were surprised.The Hess City generally accommodates up to 1 million peopleHowever, lei estimates that the population in Hess City at the moment reaches at least several millionBecause the road is crowdedIn the city of Finlay, lei has never encountered this situation“First go to a hotel to stay and you’ll come to me immediatelyShaq immediately ordered his hand to set the hotel room"Liny, let's go to dinnerShaq said with a smile, lei certainly will not refuseThis Shaq immediately took a group of people such as Lin Lei into the next hotel. The bottom of the hotel is full, but there is still private room above."Three private roomsShaq said very imposinglyWhen a group of people sit downShaq was dumbfounded when he saw the price list.Shaq grabbed the waiter next to him and scolded dissatisfiedly: "You're when I'm a fool? According to your priceIsn't this table dish worth thousands of gold coins? You slaughter people” Although the hotel is of a high grade, what identity can Shaq, high-grade hotels naturally go inThis class of hotel, a table to spend 100 gold coins is very good<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "Adult, you don't eat, you can leave"That the waiter believed so much," said the family of Hess, who is now overcrowded and has caused the price of the large family to escape.Can all be high-grade consumer places"This was a sudden shock to Shaq.Yes, two big kingdoms and the five principal countries that escaped are mostly powerful players or large families with elite guard teams.Those big families are naturally unwilling to spend low"Humph"Sha Ke snorted, and finally ordered food. When Shaq, Lin, and a group of people had eaten for a while-"His Second Highness"The man who went to find the hotel's residence came back.""How about? Where did you find it?" Shaq inquiredThe Guard shook his head and said: "The rooms of all the major hotels are now fixed. I only ran five big hotels.However, I feel itThere are too many people in the roomYour Highness, we came to Hess City too late, the five major countries, and some of the big families of the Kingdom of Han Mu are faster than usShaq nodded"You sit down and eat firstShaq looked at another Bess hairdresser. "Is full, right?" You help me find a house and buy it directlyI estimate that the Hess House is now very expensive, but even if it is expensive, it will buy one.Remember... Don't buy too muchThis houseIt's just a place where my father and I live temporarily."" Yes, His Royal Highness"The Guard immediately ordered his death and began to find houses for Shaq.Lei quietly drinking in the side, just indifference“Managing house? Look down on which houseWhen Clyde arrives, it is estimated that he will go to the house."When you know where Clyde will go, you just need to wait and see.You can wait for Clyde to dieHess Town, an ordinary residence on Ke Yan Street.In ordinary facts, a site in Hess City that is not in the central area is generally priced at around TW$ 30,000 to 3,000.However, Prince Shaw’s purchase of this mansion cost him a million coins.A large number of rich nobles poured into Hess City, which also increased the land price of Hess City.When nightLei also lived in this mansion“Then ClydeI should have lived in one of the two or three rooms.Lei walked in the mansion and carefully watched the layout of the mansionPrepare to Clyde in the futureThe night breeze is cold, lei is carefully watching the various places of this house"LEI adults, how haven't they rested yet?" said the envious Wang Hao, standing in front of the door and shouted to lei."The house is boring and breathable outsideLei replied arbitrarily"I also feel a bit boring"Then Wang Hao walked out of the room and walked towards Lin Lei."That looked lei winks but it made lei feel guilty in her heart, immediately said, "that wang xi is good enough to breathe, I first returned to the room to restLei quickly leftWhen Wang Xie saw Lin Lei leave, he could not help but displease his voice....the next morning"Two princes, Princess Wang, princess, I still have things, I left firstLei began to quit"How do you hurry, lei adults? When the king of my father arrives, he will say it again.Shaq immediately stayedLei sneer at heart: "wait for your father? If you let Clyde see me in your place of residence, I'm afraid I can only kill him clearly.It is better to kill him by secretly killing him.Lei has eaten a few lossesLei made up his mind this time"This timeIt must be forbearing that we have to endure that Clyde is not with CaesarWhen Clyde alone, I kill him again.That will certainly succeedLei understood that if caesar was in, he could not kill Clyde for a moment.Can Caesar not be, he will be successful"Well, where do the lei adults go?" Shaq inquired"I am ready to leave Hess City and continue northAs for the clear location, it has not been determinedLei replied, "wellThe Second Prince, Wang HaoPalace owner, I'm going first"One microman was saluting, and lei took the babe and left the house directly."...... That night, lei stayed in another small courtyard on Kelvin Street.The house that Shaq bought was larger and the occupancy of more than 30 people was not crowded.And this small yard bought by lei actually can hold three or four people.This small courtyard, LEI also spent 50,000 gold coins to buyUsually this small courtyard, thousands of gold coins will be enough"Ah Da, Ah Er. Did someone see that house?" LEI sat at the table and asked two men."No"The two men were hired by Lin Lei on the street today and fled to Hess City today."In addition to the nobles and many civilians, those civilians fled to Hess City and did not eat or live.Only begging, hard labor, lei is easily hiredOne day's salary of two gold coins, also eaten and wrapped, which makes a group of people fleeing to rush to the jobLei see these two brothers are more practical person, they selected the two"You can sleep at night, but you can give me a tight daytimeAs long as there are strangers in that house, especially a large number of strangers, we must inform me.Pay attention to a person who has no handsLei again entrusted the roadDo not need to be monitored at night because the Hess City Gate is not open at nightAnd lei believes that these two people have been staring at the day and as long as the people of Clyde arrive, they will surely find outPrince Nashak and other people thought that lei left Hess City, but did not know that lei lived in a house not far from them."Clyde, I'll just die here, I see when you comeLei eyes coldThe two brothers saw lei with such a facial expression that they could not help but tremble"Go on it" lei commanded"Yes, adults”
