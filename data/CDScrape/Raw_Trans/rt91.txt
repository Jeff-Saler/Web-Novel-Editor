- Lin Lei looked up and looked at the hundreds of dragons hovering above. Each fire dragon's flame around the surface would cause the air temperature to rise sharply. The green dragon with aquamarine scales exudes HeartbreakerFrostfire two heavens! And under the lei, those two huge eight-stage raptors are looking at lei for interest.At the moment, it is floating in the half-empty lei that is sixty to seventy meters away. There is nowhere to escape.And this group of dragons flying in the air are interested in watching LEI.The wisdom of Warcraft III is absolutely not inferior to human beings. lei do not know why, in front of these dragons themselves like ants, their own life and death do not care about each other, they care about is ... ... they can bring a trace of their long life pleasureTeasing! It's as if humans would tease the ants and wait until they're not interested, and then die! "I don't want to be a ant, babeLei glanced at babe, "ready to escape!" ""call out! "LEI lei rushed down to the bottom of the whole body, the body's weight plus the addition of "flying technique", lei as if the whole person slammed on the ground, but near the ground, suddenly a statureThis rapid to very slow process, so that the body of the blood lei boiling, sad to vomit blood ah"Fortunately, I am not only a magician, but also a fourth-class soldier, and my body is resistant to disease.Now behind are two huge raptors. There are over a hundred giant dragons with huge wings in the sky. There is no care, and lei rushes directly to the ridiculous front."吼~~~" The two Raptors yelled"Hey ~~~" "Hey ~~~" "Hey ~~~" ... There are more than one hundred dragons in the sky. The Green Dragon also yelled, and then the two Raptors immediately took big steps and chased them towards the lei.Every step makes the ground shakeAnd in the sky, there were more than one hundred fire dragons, and the green dragons swooped down one by one. Instantly, lei felt dark.The dragon has been so bigOver one hundredCompletely covering the sky, the dozens of fire dragons invariably opened a large mouth full of people to swallow, spit out a big fireball, leaned down to the bottom of the lei"Boom!" "Boom!" "Boom!" "Boom!" The gigantic fireball that is almost as tall as Linton and Lin Lei descends from the sky. The "Fireball" of the eighth-level dragon is not an ordinary fireball. It is not just a magic cut containing the dragon itself. Longyan, the temperature is high, I am afraid that the 7th Velociraptor's armor will burn out"Hey!" rubbed a large ball of fire on the body next to leiLin Lei escaped to smell the smell of burning hair"Boss, your hair is burnt"Bebe's voice rang in lei's headLei knows for herself that this hair is not scorched at all, only that the temperature of the fireball is too high.Lei as if the whole person is like a flexible monkey as the constant shift of direction, constantly dodging a fireballThose fire dragons did not rush to kill lei, but jokingly used fireballs to carry lei"The strength difference is too bigAlthough I am a seven-level double magicianBut for the top 8 Warcraft, it must be dead.Lei feel the terror temperature of this fireball, and those fire dragons can easily spit one after another fireballFortunately, the dragons did not want to kill LEI immediately.Suddenly, Lin Lei feels a coldThe body that adapts to high temperature does not have a shiver"Oh!" A transparent, slightly green-colored javelin was inserted next to lei, and then cracked open. The horrible cold caused lei to quickly change direction.I saw dozens of green dragons in the sky open their mouths and fired arrowsFor a large green dragon, that may be Frostbolt, but for leiThis huge three-meter ice-cream arrow is completely a horrible javelin.Under the attack of Longyan fireball and ice-cold javelin, lei made an effort to dodge and change the direction.Tired! Lei feels that she is exhaustedThe spiritual string is always so tight, it's OK for a short time. If it's a long time, the spirit of the string will definitely collapse.Lei has felt unavoidableRunning at the fastest speed, it also has a great deal of physical exertion"Hey!" A fireball squatted on lei's right armA crackling soundLin Lei had a crack in the guardian battlefield of the jadeite step, and the khaki line elements surrounded the cracks.Trying to fix the scars here"The attack is too scaryIf you hit positivelyIt is estimated that I can only resist the land guardianship of this jade step."At life and death, the life potential of lei seems to have exploded.Again fast, strange and constant dodgeThis ability to dodge and even lei are surprisedThis is definitely its peakIt's a pity that when it comes to peaks, there are no chances of winning the face of a hundred dragons."Hey ~ ~ ~" "Hey ~ ~ ~" There are hundreds of fire dragons in the sky, the Green Dragon happily teasing lei, watching lei's constant dodging, they feel even more interestingEven the two giant Raptors at the back use the threat of the tailAt this moment - lei is like an antA small ant teased by a group of powerful mastersIf you are not carefulLei will dieLei's life and death, these dragons do not care, these dragons are just thinking: “this little human can insist on what time?” five minutes! Lei stuck in this "teasing" for five minutesFive minutes, 300 seconds! It sounds very short, but lei feels so slowEvery moment, he is on the line of life and death."This group of bastards, if I dodge it, I will be killed by them.It is estimated that they will not carelessly leave and continue their comfortable life.Lei is very clear that he is a small tune of this dragon's life.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Bebe's speed is actually faster than the dragon's speed. It's alone can escape.Babe can only be on lei's shoulder nowStaring at the sky one by one, fireballs, javelins, reminding lei where there is danger"The bossBe carefulThree fireballs! Bebe suddenly shouted eagerlyLei face "Peng!" A dragon flame fireball squatted on lei's bodyThen burst openThe surface of the jadeite armor of Lin Lei had an extremely rapid flash of loess light, and then the sound of “Peng” disappeared without a trace of ground elements."Hey ~ ~" lei's hair was instantly burned, his face was hot and painfulThere is no protection for the whole body from the jade armor, whether it is Longyan fireball or ice cold javelin.Whether you are looking for dragon fireball or cold javelinIt is no doubt that you must die"I can't resist it anymore"LEI feels that the whole body's muscles are trembling. Even his head is a little dizzy. LEI knows that he has reached a limit. If he continues in this state, he will absolutely collapse."“Lei, there is a hill nearly 20 meters high at the 120 meters to the left. There is a deep place under the hill.**The hill did not completely cover the land, and there was a gap that could allow one or two people to go down. You quickly passed and you could escape."Drinkovt's voice soundedEver been killed by dragonsDrinkovt has been silent and he has heardGive hope to Lin LeishengAnd lei's speed was incredibly uplifted once againThe hope of survival does have amazing powerHundreds of fire dragons and green dragons hovering in high altitude were somewhat surprised by the reaction of lei."Huh?" discovered that Lin Lei rushed straight toward the hill. Over one hundred dragons who were holding a joking mentality immediately became angry.At one and the same time, over a hundred dragons at the same time fired dragon fireballs, cold and cold javelins, completely blocking the area of ​​twenty to thirty meters."Ah!" At the speed of lei, it took about two or three seconds to rush to the side of the hill. At this time, a large number of dragon fireballs and ice-cold javelin rushed down."Cleft!" lei suddenly saw a hole nearly two meters wideWithout hesitation, lei directly jumped pastHowever, it has not entered the hole, a Longyan fireball took the lead and smashed down, Longyan fireball speed can be much faster than the speed of lei, when the dragon flame fireball from the lei only twenty or thirty centimeters when the lei clothes even have burned stand up"Bang!" Bebe body shape is different from the expansion of No. 1 and then hit the body with the dragon fireballLei is lucky to escape into the caveBut Bebe was followed by a large number of dragon fireballs, ice cold javelin to buried "call!" lei fell all the way downIt was probably about 70 to 80 meters awaySquat on a solid surfaceThis dark groundOnly the top hole left some light, but lei's vision is very goodThe weak light is enough to see the bottom of everythingAnd at the moment - lei hair burntEven the skin on the face has two or three red burning spots.Disfigured! Lei this time did not care for these, he is worried about babe"Yeah!" A dark shadow crashed from above and fell to the ground next to Lin Lei. "Oh, it's comfortable. It's hot for a while. I'm so comfortable."Bebe's voice rang in lei's headLei happy to pick up babe: "bebe, are you okay?" babe's face is dirty, but he proudly small nose wrinkled "that is of course, my babe's strength is comparable to a year and a half Stronger than before, if I let me fight with the front of the World of Warcraft, I am not afraid, but also afraid of a little small Mars, small ice?" lei laughed, babe all right, lei is also a relaxed heart"Then why did you not kill the dragons?"said LinBebe said indignantly: "My babe wouldn't be afraid of them? But their scales are too thick. I am too young and my mouth is too small.A bite does not wear their scalesI'm hard to kill them, but they don’t want to kill meLei laughed"Boss, what happened to your face? Disfigured!" The sound of Babe's weirdness rang out loudly in the head of lei.**Looked at the facial muscles, lei felt a burst of burning pain, can only be self-deprecating: "bebe, although I exercise physical strength, but no exercise can also exercise less facial muscles, ah, defense is not enough"" Huh, Bebe, let me rest firstI am exhaustedLei let go babe, lying directly on the groundJust a period of time, whether it is body muscles or spirit, lei have reached the limitWhen it was dangerous, it was okay, but now it is safe. LEI feels endless exhaustion, and lei just wants to rest in the valley.Hundreds of dragons hovering in the air, and eight raptors looking at the hill"Hey ~~~~" Suddenly the largest dragon firedAll the dragons and the raptors retreated, and the largest dragon watched the hill with a hint of horror in his eyes.The entrance to the underground cavern is very large, and even a dragon can enter it.Then the dragons, the Green Dragons, were ordered to move to a hill and block the underground entrance.For the dragon, there is nothing in the gap of nearly two meters.Can’t get in at all with their sizeHowever, for leiBut you can easily enter"Into the forbidden land, this mankind must die."The biggest fire dragon then rose into the sky and left here.This is a forbidden place in the misty valley. Not to mention humans. It is a family of dragons. The Green Dragon family does not dare to go in. Whenever you go in, no one can live out.This is the iron law in the misty valley
