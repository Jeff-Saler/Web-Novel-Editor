Night black inkThe voice of the carriage sounded on the street outside the secluded royal palace. lei was sitting inside the carriage and the shadowed mouse babe was lying on his lap.Next to the carriage is a dozen knights riding a horse, headed by a commanding court waiter.Carriage interiorLei frowned: "now it's late, but he suddenly called me to Clyde, in the end what to do?" the so-called heart is not a ghost, naturally candidHowever, lei killed Paderson, and lei is very clear that when he ordered Paderson to send his mother away, it was Clyde.Say, he still has a great feud with this Clyde.In the hearts of lei, Clyde was naturally small. "I heard that Clyde had captured the housekeeper of the Ducale House two days ago and began to search for things about Padson.That Padson said to me that he did not tell anyone to see meBut is this statement credible? " lei heart did not endMaybe the housekeeper knew that Paderson saw leiIf, the housekeeper of the Ducal Mansions told Clyde about this news, then the lei naturally came to the forefront"LEI, don't worry about it"Drincowwater appeared next to lei, comforting lei." lei, even if the steward's housekeeper knows that paderson will see you, it's okay."" It's okay? Lei puzzled look to delincowaterDeling Kewater nodded confidently: "That is of courseEven if Clyde guessed that you killed Paderson, he wouldn’t say it clearly."" Because ... Clyde, I don't know why you killed Paderson."Drinkovt is full of self-confidenceLei surprised, even if he did not know why he killed Paderson, but after all, he killed Paderson himself."It's easyFrom the conversation between you and Padson in the secret room that day, this relationship between Padson and Clyde is not very good.Padson was embezzled when he was Finance MinisterClyde's heart may not have much affection for Padson.Another point... Clyde didn't know that you had a deep hatred with him.So he will not deal with you for no reasonBecause, to punish you or kill you, you must pass the agreement of the Holy See."Dring Corvette blinked in disdain"Oh, that Clyde is also a king? The Holy See has completely removed his rights.And you, the brightest church is very importantDoes he dare to deal with you? “Drinking Watert comforter saidLei noddedHe understands this truthBut... lei really does not want to let clyde be wary of himOnce he is wary, how can he find out about his mother's affairs and how to retaliate for his mother's original affairs? "Open the door, it's me"The court waiter squeakedLei knew at a glance that at the moment it had entered the Palace of the Palace.Just like a beast quietly entrenched on the earthA carriage has entered the palace in succession in just half an hour.Among them, there are carriages carrying lei, carriages with Bernard, carriages with other nobles.Among the halls of the Royal PalaceIn addition to the two guards at the entrance of the Chamber, the Chamber of Commerce is a noble family with a high status in the city of Finlay. There are eight in total.Bernard, the Patriarch of DebusThe first magician of the palace, LEI, the Duke of Left Duke Bernard, supervised the Minister Hampton... "LEI, you are here!"Duke Bernard greeted with enthusiasmSeveral aristocrats and adults who had arrived at the scene immediately greeted him. As soon as lei saw that these aristocrats could not help but be certain, it seemed that he was not specifically looking for himself."Everybody, I don't know if you know the Majesty of the King. What did you do with us this time?" lei immediately inquired.The Duke of Bernard, as the leftI know a lot of information"This call usIt should be for the Duke of Paderson to disappearThe Duke of Bernard smiled kindly and answeredNext to Bernard, he immediately inquired: "When an adult duke, Prince Padson is missing, what did he do for me? Did I not hold any important positions in the court?"Your majesty is not convening a prime minister.Why else would I come? Why did you not come from right?Why did the Minister of Supervision only come to one? The Duke of Bernard saw clearlyBernard noddedBut Bernard’s heart is still a bitSince the disappearance of Padson, Bernard has always been worried about the fear of the Derbus family and Paderson smuggling water jade ore leaked out.When this matter leaked out, the Debuss family could really be finished."Your Majesty, to--" suddenly the court waitress squealed, and from the side door of the Chamber, under the courtesy of the two courtiers, Clyde sat down directly in front of his seat."See you under the armThe eight nobles on the court shouted at the same timeClyde looked at the eight aristocrats in front of him and nodded indifferently. "Now it's late at night. I didn't want to bother you. It was just that my younger brother, Paderson, was missing. It was too important.I have to invite you to gather here"The Grand Duke of Paderson is missing. Do you not know why you are calling us? Lei directly inquiredOf the eight people below, I'm afraid that only LEI dared to speak with Clyde.Because others are looking at Clyde's face, and lei actually belongs to the Holy See, just hanging in the Kingdom of Finlay."LEI, I just want to find out the factsClyde smiled, and then replied, "Bring Lodi to the House of the Duke.“Loddy Housekeeper of the Duke House? Lin Lei and Bernard of the Debus Group are a bit surprisedThe entire hall was quietEveryone was waiting for Lodi to be sent over.Lei is standing on one side, shadow mouse beibei is on lei shouldersJust for a while - a middle-aged man with long, buffy hair came in under the escort of a court guard. The middle-aged man had a dull face and his hair was a bit cluttered and looked a little lonely.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>Bernard recognized at a glanceThis person was looking for his landlord Lodi at the Duke House some time ago."Lodie, you will tell things honestly.Clyde asked Dr. Lodi directlyThis Lodi apparently told Clyde earlier on, and apparently only let lei and others hearLodi replied very honestly: "Your Majesty, on the 18th of June, the Debuss family held an engagement banquet. The Duke of adults went to an engagement party.And after the engagement banquet, the Duke he never returned"" Lodi, you stand firstClyde said coldly"Yes, Your MajestyLodi looked a little scaredIn a hurry to stand upClyde gazes at the eight nobles below“According to the information I've been investigating, on the night of the engagement banquet of the Debus family, you were the last few people to leave. I would like to ask, Did you ever see Padson?” Clyde asked very easily.“The party just ended and Padson left first"The left-handed Bohner said directlyLei also nodded: "I also saw Padson left early."Other people didn't even see it, or said that Padson left earlyWhen I heard everyone say it, Clyde nodded with a smile, but looking to the side of Lodi: "Lodie, you continue to say""YesLodi said again“The Duke of Padson said to me before going to the Debus House. He was going to meet someone who was important to him this time, but this matter was very important and could not be known to others.So he ordered me to arrange an embarrassment and return the duke to the Ducale House.In fact, the Duke is still in the Debus family."" The Duke said, the Debus family will arrange for him to meet people's secret placesLodi added another sentenceThis sentence suddenly made the leader of the Debus family patriarch Bernard face white."His MajestyHis MajestyBernard said quickly. "It has nothing to do with me. The Lord Duke told me to meet someone, so let me arrange a hidden place."I have to arrange"" BernardDon't worry, I won't marry youClyde said with a smile"Xie XiaxiaBernard retreated to the sideOnly his face was paleClyde looked at a few people in the lei: "Padderson, he wants to see a person, this person should naturally be a bit of identity, he met with whom? I thinkMost likely it was a guest who left late in the dayLei heart startledThe Duke of Bernard, the Earl of Junot, the Marquis of Hampton and others were all surprised to see Clyde.They guessed a bit why the King asked them to come over.It turned out that His Majesty the King doubted them! "Your Majesty, we didn't meet with him.The Duke of Berner, Hampton, and others said one after anotherClyde said with a smile: "I'm just skeptical. You haven't done anything to worry about something. Look, among you people, it's also the most calming of lei.Lei smiled and did not say anythingClyde looked at this group of people and smirked at his heart: "While Padson was missing, I can't be too lazyInstead, I would like to thank that person for giving me the best opportunity to destroy Paderson, the secret relationship established by Padson, and occupying the position of Minister of Finance for many years.Established a very dense network of contacts with great influenceClyde does not dare to check Padson at random, worrying about turmoil in the entire kingdomThis is also the reason why the Debus Group and Paderson cooperated.And now Padson is missing and the dragons have no headsClyde displayed the thunder means and ordered his men and women to quickly resolve Paderson’s wings and directly destroy Paderson’s years of relationship network.Without Padson's deployment, the group of people with whom he was mixed resisted a natural mess and could not resist Clyde’s means.Clyde looked at several people such as Lin Lei and smiled and said: "My second brother Padson's disappearance, I had to find out, but what surprised me most was that I found out a lot of things.Especially Lodi, he said a lot of secretsLei could not help but look at Lodi"Lodi, say to themClyde smiled and looked at LodiClyde at the moment is full of ecstasy, and a brother died for Clyde.What's important is that ... the entire kingdom is finally in full control.Lodi respectfully said: "Your Majesty, the Duke of Paderson took part in the engagement banquet of the Debus family that day.The reason why you want to see the mysterious person is to pull the relationship with the Dawson Chamber of Commerce.So...he who he met must have a close relationship with the Dawson Chamber of Commerce.""Dawson Chamber of Commerce? Lei felt his heart could not help but twitch"Isn't everyone wondering why my younger brother had to pull the relationship with the Dawson Chamber of Commerce?" Clyde smiled at everyone below. "Loddy, you continue to say""Yes“Loddy apparently had been completely overcome by Clyde. What did you say?” For many years, Duke Padson has done a lot of things to betray the interests of the kingdom, only to satisfy personal desires.Especially in the first few months, it also started to smuggling Shuiyu ore together with the Debusi family. This is the largest smuggling of water jade ore in the history of the Kingdom of Finlay.""boom! “Bernard, the head of the Debus family, went straight down and quickly said, “Your Majesty, oh,The Debus family has always been doing business and has never done anything to betray the national interest.We have a Debus family.""What? Clyde glanced coldly at Bernard"Bring with the Lansir brothersThe Debuss family ate outsideWhen Bernard, the chief of the Debuss family, heard Lancel's name, his face suddenly lost his blood.
