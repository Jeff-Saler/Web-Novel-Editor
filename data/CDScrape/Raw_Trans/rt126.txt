Padson completely understood at the moment of dyingIn particular, he participated in the lei worship of his father, lei lei's father is deadIt's ridiculous that he still wanted to leave alive just now, but now he fully understands why lei did it.Padson's heart is deeply unwilling, and he is not willing to die like this. With the strength of his seven-level fighters, it is not difficult to live for two or three hundred years.His future is still long"I'm dead, Clyde don't think too much"Padson had only a kind of resentment in his soul when he was swallowed by the underworld, and he resented Clyde."... witnessing Paderson's death, lei has also returned to normal form"Clyde, the person behind him is Clyde.Lei brow wrinkled deeplyClyde himself is the nine strong, lei is a full dragon, just entered the eighth levelIt's not a level with Clyde at all.Lei is a sneak attack, but also can not hurt a nine strongThe gap is really too bigAnd Clyde’s power is also strongDignified King of Finlay Kingdom. And for many years, Clyde, as King of the Kingdom of Finlay, who was the first of the six kingdoms of the sacred alliance, had a very good relationship with the Holy See.The foundation is also much deeper than myselfRegardless of its own strength, it is better than Clyde."Perhaps, I just now have the advantage of being in the darkLei constantly thinking about how to deal with clydeDrincowout emerged from the Panlong Ring and immediately reminded the lei: "LEI, don't waste time. All you have to do now is to quickly eliminate all traces of your identity.You must hurry back to your houseOtherwise you will be too lateAfter checking who killed Paderson, you may suspect you"Lin Lei suddenly awokeCorrect! His only advantage is in the dark, and Clyde cannot be alerted to himself anyway"Let it be destroyed"Lei immediately immediately sent dozens of flame balls. Dozens of flame balls directly wrapped Padson's body. With the spiritual power of lei, the flame ball temperature is still very high.Padson’s body was burned at a high speed, and a very unpleasant odor spread out. After a while, there was only a little bit of dark yellow bone and ash.The unique flavor of the cremated lei could not help frown"lei, and your clothes“Drincowwater reminds usLei looked down and sawAfter the ‘Longhua’, his clothes have been completely damaged.Lei took his own things and then he immediately took off his coat and pants without hesitationThe clothes will be immediately burned cleanLei immediately opened the agency“嘎嘎~~” Shek Mun was opened again and lei quickly walked out and immediately closed down on this institution.Anyway, this stone gate is still closedIf it is otherwise open, the smell of burning corpse may soon attract people."There should be clothes in this small building.Lei looked at his body's underwear, broken underwear can not be transmitted naturallyThis will certainly cause doubts from othersLei immediately stepped into the next room and opened the closetA set of clothes is hanging in the closetLei chooses a set of black clothes that are more like clothes when they comeAfter putting on clothes, lei used wind magic again to dispel the faint smell of blood and the smell of burning corpses around the body surface."Let's go back soonerNot to be alarmedLei whole person leaps quicklyJumped directly from the small building yardAlmost a few seconds later came to the front yardAt the moment there are still a few noble guests talking and laughing with each other."Ah, lei adultsHaven't you left yet? "The Earl of Juno is also walking toward the outside this time, seeing lei not far from the greet of a warm greetingLei smiled and said: "Well, I was not feeling wellGo to the toilet” Earl Juno immediately walks alongside LEI"I'm very fond of your stone carving work, lei ren adults. The three works that you auctioned for the first time at the Prussian Guild were the ones I bought." Earl Juno proudly told leiThe most proud thing about Earl Juno’s is probably to have bought three works from the first exhibition of Lin Lei.Lin Lei’s three works, I am afraid that simply from the work itself, each one is worth 6,000 gold coinsHowever, the identities of lei today are different. He carved a sculptural master of ‘waking up’, and his identity and Prouks and Hopkinson are not much different.How about the price of three works that are sold for the first time in such characters? According to estimates, it is because of the significance of the work that the three pieces of the collection of the Earl of Juno each have at least 100,000 gold coins! This is probably the most proudly collected by the Earl of Juneau.The count of Juno also decided that these three works should be kept in collections. He believes that... The higher the achievements of lei, the higher the value of his three works will go up."lei adults, walk slowly“The steward at the gate of the Debus House family respectfully told leiLei nodded and bid farewell to Earl of juno and entered his own carriage"go back"Into the carriage, lei indifferently ordered"Yes, adults"The Seventh-class Soldier of the Holy See went to death and immediately drove past the carriage to the residence of Lin Lei."With Padson, it took almost fifteen minutesLei took a look at the pocket watchThis pocket watch is one of the gifts given by many guests to Hershey after lei was sealed as Marquis.Because I like the style of this pocket watch, so lei is also close to"fifteen minutesThe Earl of Juneau was almost the last guest to leave.If you do not investigate carefully, nobody should suspect meLei treacherously said, "There is also a problem. Padson said that his steward knew that he wanted to see people, but he did not know who he was meeting."<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> Lin Lei frowned and said: "But this can't be believed, maybe Padson's steward, knows What Padson saw was meAnd Paderson may have let me rest assured that he deliberately said soLei also thought of this possiblePadson's steward! It is indeed a loopholeAnd... if you seriously investigateI am afraid that others will also find out, where did lei go in the last fifteen minutes? Only the nobles chatted casually and left behind and afterAt that time, it was also difficult to find a person.“At least no one saw with my own eyes that Paderson had met me and the waiter had been killed by Padson."lei heart in the darkMost people doubt themselves, but there is no evidence to start"Boss, what do you think?" babe squatted in lei's lap, raised his head to look at lei"It's nothingLei touched beibei's head, the whole person completely calm down"grown upArrivedLei opened the curtain, looked up and saw the endless night skyThe night sky is full of starsLEI couldn't help but carelessly, and Clyde's heart was even more firm in his heart: "Padderson is dead today.Next, it's the turn of Clyde."The next day after Padson's disappearance, except for Padson's steward, no one else realized that something was wrong."In the Debus family's living room, only Bernard and a middle-haired"Bernard, Ka Lan was engaged that evening, did the Duke leave from you?" Pepsi middle-aged man askedThis middle-aged Pelican is the steward of the Duchess of Padson, ‘Lodi’.Bernard's heart is full of wrongsYour Lord Duke is goneyou ask me? Bernard knowsThat night Duke Padson did not even tell him that he did not say a word when he went to the ground.How could he know Bernard? "The Duke leftThere is no Duke in my houseBernard answered directlyOn the second day of the engagement ceremony, Bernard sent someone to deal with the waiter's body. He did not find the Duke of Paderson in the small building."OhLodi frowned and then looked to Bernard."Bernard, if you find the trace of my adult, you must tell me.This matter can be light and heavy, and even things that may have caused your Debus family to be smuggled out are also exposed.Bernard could not help but change his face"Okay, I'll go back firstLodi left with a great deal of thoughtLooking at the back of Lodi's departure, Bernard was a little upset and decided to go to the small building where Padson once went.The Debus House is among the hidden small buildings.Bernard stepped into it alone. The carcass of the waiter who had died at the door of the living room in the small building was already treated by Bernard. Bernard looked at the small building and frowned. "Padderson The Duke said that he would meet a guest here, but later he did not go back.Is it..." Bernard thought of a possibilityIn this small building, there are few people in the Debus family.The man who naturally picks up the body will not know it, nor will he go inAnd in this secret room, Bernard told the Duke of Padson, he also told the Duke of Padson, in the secret room to discuss things that no one had ever heard."Impossible, that kind of thing can't happenBernard stepped into the living room and immediately walked to the closet office and opened the office.“嘎嘎~~” The stone gate, which looks like a wall, slowly opened again. At the same time, a bloody stench and a stench of a burning corpse whistled.Bernard's face is not helplessStepping into the secret room, there are several cracks in the marble floor and there is bloodOn the side there is a pile of bones and ash"Someone diedBernard is very clearHowever, this person was burned to ashes and Bernard could not discern who"Ring!" Bernard suddenly saw a gray, dingy ring in the ashes. Bernard looked at the style of the ring and was very similar to the ring often worn by the Duke of Padson.Bernard has no blood on his face"Padson, I'm afraid I'm dead.Bernard’s brains were confusedThis time, the Debuss family spent more than half of the family’s funds and a large number of people. Together with the Duke of Padson, they began to smuggle the business of Shuiyu ore.This business is still very important for the Debus family.However, once this business is made public ... it is not a loss of money, I am afraid that the Debus family will be directly copied by Cinder in the fury! The entire Debus family may be finished directly"No, it's impossible to die, but Duke Padson is a seven-level warrior. How can he die so easily? With his discreet personality, he will never meet a secret person who surpasses him.Bernard could not accept this resultIndeed, the Duke of Padson is very cautious, but it is a pity that Paderson is not considered the real strength of the lei... The entire city of Finlay is still calm, and lei is still practicing quietly in his own house. However, when the Duke of Padson disappeared for half a month, he was still in the silence of King Clyde and finally orderedThe first was to directly capture the keeper of the Ducale House, Lodi, and then to investigate the matter on a large scale.Lei living in the living room"The lei adults, under the command of the majesty, please ask the lei adults to visit the palace"Looking at the command given by the court waiter in front of him, lei's heart is not quite the same. Clyde ordered him to go to the end." Wait a minute, I'll change my clothes and I'll go to the palace immediately.Lei replied with a smile
