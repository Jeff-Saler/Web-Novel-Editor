Hillman was punctured by a pair of lei clothes clutched by lei. The red blood slowly penetrated and dyed the red clothes.But Hillman doesn't seem to feel itHillman stared at lei, Shen Sheng said: "lei, you calm down first""tell meLei stared at leiHillman solemnly said: "The cavalry behind the team is coming soon. Don't let others know about your family.You come with me firstHillman broke away from the lion's claws, grabbed the lei covered with black dragon scales arm, they would like to rifle toward the direction of the ancestral hall, but this one is not shaken"LeiHillman turned over, somewhat irritated"Uncle Hillman, I knowLei looked like water, but he took a deep breath, the dragon scales covered by his arms once again received the bodyThe whole person has returned to normalWhen he knelt down to hold the sword again in his arms, lei heard the hoof sounds outside.The cavalry team of the Holy See has finally arrivedLei looked back and looked indifferent, but regardless of them, said directly to Hillman: "Uncle Hillman, you lead the way ahead""it is good"Sillman saw lei calm down and feel better in her heart, immediately walked in the direction of leiAnd lei is still a calm face, at this moment, I am afraid that in addition to lei himself, others simply can not imagine lei calm under the surface, hidden deep painThe Shadow Mouse 'Babe' and Drincowat did not say anythingThey are related to the soul of lei, naturally feel lei's unprecedented pain, sadness风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风 风"Oh--" Hillman pushed open the door to the building and then looked at Lin Lei. Lin Lei quietly walked in with the sword and sculptor.However, his eyes are still on the row of spiritual positions in the hall. With the eyes of Lin Lei, he clearly sees the newest one on the front row.There is only the word 'Hogg & Baruch' on the frontThere is still a fantasy of lei, felt a dizzy brain, but he still stands stillThen lei walked up with a sword and ‘sculptor’ and eventually placed the giant sword’s ‘killer’ on the stone table where Ling was placed.Lei looked at the location of Ling Ling, his face showing a trace of a quiet smile, whispered: "Father, I'm back"" I know that your greatest desire in this life is to find the treasure of the family and even to reproduce the glory of our Dragon Blood Warrior family."Lei seems to worry about whoThe voice is very slight and very carefulLei stared at this spiritual position: "I did not disappoint youI've brought back my Baruch family, my Dragon Blood Warrior's family heritage treasure sword ‘Muyu’.""just nowI bring back the sword and slay it. Soon, I will let my Dragon Blood Warrior family regain its glory.I will let the people of the Magnolia mainland know the glory of the Dragon Blood Warrior family and let your name be known throughout the Magnolia continent."" I swear I will do all thisLei suddenly face more than a hint of gas, "of course before this, I want to revenge for you"no doubtHis own father, Hogg, must have been killedOtherwise, the strength of the father's six fightersIn addition, when you are in prime time, you will not be sent to life by the general illness.If it is deadlyUncle Hillman will not hide at allWith lei's intuition, the death of his father is not ordinary"Killing your peopleI must also let him die! ! ! ” Lin Lei eyes seem to have more than a glimmer of iron armored dragon that cold dark gold, people feel trembling dark goldLei suddenly turned to look at Hillman: "Uncle Hillman, tell me, how did my father died? And where is his father buried? And you say that his father has been dead for more than three months, you Why didn't you tell meHillman opened his mouth but didn't say anything"LEI, you calm down firstHillman said slowlycalm? How calm? "I was so eager to let my father see the battle knife 'the slaughter' with his own eyes, how eager it was for his father to see that he could become a dragon blood warrior, and how he wanted to see his father's smile. After the gratified smile, the proud smile that saw him become a 'dragon blood warrior'! However... it's all impossible.Lei felt like a knifeAt this time, Hillman will let him calm! Lei wants to yell at hillman, but he resistsTake a deep breath and swallow all the unwillingness and anger.Lei stares at Hillman: "Uncle Hillman, tell me everything goes, I want to know all things"Your father was dead and died three months ago."But before your father died, he asked me... unless you reach the 7th level, you cannot tell him the cause of his death.Hillman said solemnly"Seven soldiers?" "YesHillman gently nodded and said, "This is why I went to your college to find you, but did not tell you the reason why your father died."In accordance with your father’s wishes before death, he hopes that you will calm down as much as possible without knowing the news of his death.Hillman looked at LEI: "LEI, I don't want to tell you, but because this is your father's last chance, I can't go against it."Unless you reach the strength of a seven-level warrior, I can tell you everythingLei understandsSeven soldiers? Lei set a leather book from his arms and handed it to Hillman"This is?" Hillman took over"Magic Level ProofLei face quietEach magician will be awarded this magician's certificate from the beginning to assess the level.For each level of promotion, there will be records on it.Hillman opened the book, and the land was lined with the wind. It had seven dazzling stars.<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div> "Seven-level, seven-level double magician?" Hillman was shockedIncredibly watching leiHow big is lei? Seventeen years oldWhat does it mean to be a seventeen year old double magician? Hillman is not clear, but he knowsThroughout Kingdom of Finlay, the most powerful magician is also the eighth-level magician.But it was an old man in his one hundred years old.Hillman still remembered when he was in the army, when a 7th-level wizard arrived, the style, the prestige.But he looked at the small lei that grew up, unexpectedly it was a seven-level double-line magician."This, is this true?" Hillman asked a very silly word, Hillman also knew that the magician proved absolutely not false"Uncle HillmanYou can tell me the truth nowLei stares at hillmanHillman nodded and walked towards the secret chamber behind the hall.Just a moment came out, went to lei took a letter from her armsWhispered to LEI: "This is the letter left by your father before his death.You already know when you see itLei's hands shook slightly and took the letterThere is no handwriting on the envelopeOpen the envelope and there are two pages of content"LEI: When you open this letter, I may have been dead for a long time.For you and Wharton, there is endless apology in my heart, but I have no way to compensate you again.I just hope that you will be able to spend a period of time as long as possible, so I let you uncle HillmanWhen you reach the Seventh Warrior, give this letter to you"See hereLei heart in a acidKeep yourself calm for a while? I'm afraid my father couldn’t think of himself as a 7th-level magician so soon.After all, at normal speed, from level 6 to level 7It takes a long time"LEI, there is a secret in my heart. Your mother is not born to live in Wharton."Father's words shocked Lin LeiSince childhood, Lin Lei knew that her mother was born and died in Wharton.But now it seems that it was only a lie“When your mother was pregnant again, she and I were very happy. However, medical conditions in Wushan Town were too bad. I set off with your mother and headed to the city of Finlay. In the city of Finlay, your mother gave birth safely to a small child. Wharton, Little Wharton is very cute. I was very happy with your mother. Shortly after Wharton was born, I and your mother took small Wharton to the Temple of Light to pray for Wharton.I was very happy with your mother that day. Then we left the Temple of Light and stayed overnight in the hotel in the city of Finlay."" That night, a group of mysterious people came to the hotel and took away your mother directlyI survived Wharton only when I was outnumbered, but I also saw a birthmark with a spider on one of the murderers’ arms."Look at this, lei felt like he had returned to the night of ten years.A group of mystery people besieged and robbed. The widow's father could only keep Wharton. He could only watch his inability to save his beloved wife."I know that the group of people are not ordinary people. The weakest are four-level fighters. The strongest one is stronger than I. Fortunately, those people are only your mother or I was already killed.Being able to send such a team is not a small person in the city of Finlay.I did not dare to speak loudly. I returned with a small Wharton. I just said that your mother was not productive.And this secret, the housekeeper, Shiri, and your uncle, Hillman, all know it.Lei saw this, in his heart puzzledAmong the group of people, the strongest is stronger than their father.But they didn’t care about their father but just took away their mother.Where can the mother deserve to be robbed by the other? "I can't tell you this thing. For more than ten years, I have always hidden this secret in my heart.I dare not say anything... Even if I can't go alone to inquire about your mother, is life or death, who is the group of people? I dare not find out"Father's words, but also made lei feel distressed"I am the heir of the Dragon Blood Warrior family. At least I must train you to grow up.I can't break the Baruch familyI've been braving every year, but it's hard to sleep every night late at night. Your mother is dead or dead. This has been tormenting me.I endured... I have endured for eleven years! "" lei, you are very proud of meFirst became a student of the first Magic Academy in Magnolia, and later became a genius at Ernst Magic School. I’m very confident in you.Even Wharton's blood stasis of the Dragon Blood Warrior has met the requirementsI am very proud that both sons are so good that I can afford the ancestors of the Baruch family! But even at this time, I dare not go to inquire about your mother because Wharton still needs a lot of money to pay expensive tuition fees""I endured for eleven years and when you handed over to me a large number of magic crystal cores that you obtained from the Mountain of Warcraft, I knew that day...I could finally let go of everything to check your mother's life and death." Although your mother has not come back for eleven years, your mother has died, but I don’t want to give up. Even if I die, I’ll have to revenge her.Lei saw this, his hands were tremblingLei understood that in the past, his father had been afraid of looking for his mother’s affairs regardless of his life because he was responsible for the expensive tuition fees of his younger brother.The Magic Crystal Nucleus, worth nearly 80,000 gold coins, left his father completely unburdened“I can finally check it out. I change my appearance and change my identity into the city of Finlay.I began to trace things of the year""It was too long. I only knew that there was a birthmark of red spider on my arm. I searched for nearly a year and finally discovered the person who had a birthmark of red spiders."Following this line, I continued to check it out. Gradually...I finally knew the people behind this group of people."The behind-the-scenes instructers of this group of people are the royal family of the Kingdom of Finlay, the younger brother of King Klay, the Duke of Padson."”
