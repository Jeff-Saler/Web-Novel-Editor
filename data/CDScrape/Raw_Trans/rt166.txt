Now I already know where he isHe can't escapeLei is full of confidence at the moment, and ‘bebe’, who has a soul connection with him, is monitoring Clyde’s group of people.SayingLei has come to Ke Yan StreetTo prevent myself from being seen by the people of ClydeLei directly from the mansion, the small courtyard in a number of small alleys shuttle, and finally through the back door into the garden that he purchasedA black afterimage suddenly passed through a distance of ten meters and jumped into the arms of lei.“BebeLei smiled and looked at the shadow mouseBebe eyes shining bright soul exchange: "the bossI saw Clyde not long ago, but I only had time to see Clyde's half face, and he entered the house.The two men in your place of employment are too uselessDid not find Clyde""?" LEI some doubtsHe ordered the two to keep guarding during the dayAccording to reason, as long as Clyde appearedThe two will definitely find Clydeland"Adult, Adult"The two of them came to the floor and respected him."Adults, we just found a large group of people entering that house.""A large group of people? Are there any broken hands?" lei immediately askedThe ‘father’ shook his head and said, “No, you said, let’s let us note that someone entered this house and told youLet us also pay attention to people who are severedHowever, we did not see any severed hand among the group of people.""impossibleLei certainly said"There must be someone with a broken handBabe had already seen Clyde's half face, and it was absolutely impossible for him to misidentifySince Babe confirmed, Clyde must be in it"Sure there?" The man listened to lei so sureRoad"Adults, maybeMaybe that group of people is too much. I don’t see my older brother.Lei frownedThere are too many people? When Clyde was in the palace, he was killed by only a dozen or so people.And there are so many World of Warcraft on this road, Clyde and a group of people can have ten people who will not come out.So many people, still called more? "Many peopleHow much?" lei asked"a lot ofAt least seventy and eighty people"The man indulged in uncertainty"A lot of peopleThe big crowd suddenly appearedThen they all entered the house. Both of our brothers couldn't see everyone. One of them might be broken.Lei puzzledSeventy or eighty?

The gold inside was absolutely gold, half a bag.At least 50His heart immediately thrilledHe fled from the field to Hess City, where even eating and drinking was a problem. lei hired them to come in. A few days later, lin lei gave them fifty gold coins. How did he not surprise him?"Thank you, adultThank you, adults"He made up his mind that he must have taken a good look at the man in the manor house with his elder brother. He immediately retired.I went to an outside tavern and sat with my big brotherBy the way, it is not far from monitoring the residence of Clyde.In the courtyardLei is thinking aloneA white light flew out of the ring of dragons and eventually turned into a white-haired white-haired, white-haired, gray-haired, gray-haired, gray-haired bearded delinker. Deling Kewater stroked his own white beard.Laughing: "LinHow? In distress?" lei looked up at Drincowwater and saw Grandpa DelinLei feels his heart will be settled, there is such an elder besideAt least lei does not panic at the end"Grandpa DelinI was wondering where the large group of people beside Clyde came fromLei saidDerlin Kewater laughed and said, "You are wasting your time thinking about this.Not as good as direct dong, hide in a careful inspectionAt that time, you naturally know who the people around Clyde are."<div class="readmidad"><script>read_adout('read_middle');</script></div>LEI laughedYeah, what time was it wasting time?
