[] []Chapter 1: Jian ChenWithin a seemingly endless chain of mountain ranges, there were two sword-shaped mountain peaks well over a thousand feet tall and a hundred meters apart from each other as it towered under the vast ocean of clouds
Both of these sword-shaped mountains were extremely precipitous and looked as if two gods had once stabbed their swords into the world
 No matter where one looked, there was no way to climb up these mountains
At the very top of these peaks, there was only less than a hundred meters between one peak to the next
 There was a faint amount of fog that hampered the visibility of the area to a confusing degree
 However, despite the hazy visibility, one would still be able to faintly make out two people standing at the very top of the mountain peaks calmly and motionlessly as if they were stone statues
 Only their clothes and wind had fluttered with the fierce gale of wind that blew across the sky
Between these two people, one of them was a youth that was no older than 20 years old
 This youth was incredibly handsome with a flawless facial appearances
 It could be said that his appearances was simply unrivaled throughout the world and was a natural lady killer
 His rather ordinary-looking eyes contained a unique amount attractiveness and fascination to them and seemed as if it could steal the soul of whomever
The youth had long black hair with a length that reached his waist without being tied up in any way, allowing it to float freely in the fierce wind as if it was dancing
 On his back was a single long sword that was wrapped up in a thick white layer of cloth
 On the exquisite sword hilt that stuck out from the cloth, one could make out the two words “Light Wind”
 What was most puzzling about the sword however was the fact that there had been no ropes binding it to the youth at all
 It seemed as if it was stuck to the back of the youth without any chance of falling–clearly a very hard display to explain
This youth’s name was Jian Chen, the number one expert with a name that shook the Heavens and the Jianghu with the moniker of “Sword God”
 His quick sword techniques had long since reached perfection and could be considered the sword master of the generation
 Despite being only 20 or so years old, he had already reached a realm of great heights
The details regarding Jian Chen were relatively unknown to the people of the Jianghu
 Aside from that he was an orphan with no affiliations to any school or sect, there was nothing else known about him
 His history was essentially a riddle, and the strong style of martial arts and the exquisite sword style he used had been an utter mystery on where to learn it
And on the other sword-shaped peak a hundred meters away was a single large man wearing black robes
 This was an elderly man who looked to be around 50 to 60 years old with hair that was tied up in the same fashion of the neck of a crane
 Both of his elderly eyes lit up with a lively spirit that seemed to shine with a light that lit up the entire area
 His gaze had been like a sharp sword that would make anyone unwilling to look straight at him
 In his hand was a black and thick long sword
 But what was most surprising was that this giant sword had no edge to it
This elderly man was the legendary figure that had disappeared from the Jianghu over a hundred years ago: Dugu Qiubai
 But that was only a nickname of his since no one had any idea on what his true name or identity was
 The reason for this was because over a hundred years ago, he had defeated every single ‘unparalleled’ super-experts
 Nowadays, the amount of people that knew anything about Dugu Qiubai and were still alive were far and few
 But even now, the splendid light he had cast in his former days had been passed on from generation to generation
 A hundred years later, his strength was surely much stronger than before; meaning that there was no one that knew just how strong Dugu Qiubai had become
Silently, Dugu Qiubai stared at the 20 or so years old Jian Chen from a hundred meters away
 His eyes were extremely terrifying and seemed to contain a sharp sword-like glare that seemed as if it could freeze someone at times
“Jian Chen, despite being so young, you have a strength that is no weaker than mine
 Your achievements in the way of the sword is something that even I can only hope to attain
 But unfortunately, you’ve killed my one dear disciple, leaving me no choice but to take revenge
 No matter what, I will act in place of my disciple for the sake of justice today
” Dugu Qiubai’s spoke darkly
 His previously calm voice had already started to fill up with a bloodlust that would cause people to tremble and shake
But Jian Chen’s face remained calm as ever as he stared back at Dugu Qiubai impassively
 His white robes fluttered gently into the air while the hair that dangled at his waist was sent dancing in the wind freely
“I cannot be blamed for that
 It was your disciple that decided to offend me first
 It could only be blamed on his lack of skill that he was killed by my own sword
” Jian Chen’s lips opened and closed gently as the words came flowing out from his mouth
Laughing angrily, Dugu Qiubai spoke, “A lack of skill? Very well then! Then today I will see just how experienced you are
 Let this old man see where you will be able to execute me with your Light Wind Sword
”As he spoke, Dugu Qiubai waved his Heavy Iron Sword
 Immediately, a strong amount of Sword Qi began to escape the sword before shooting straight for Jian Chen a hundred meters away with the speed of a lightning bolt
Unsheathing his sword with an impassive face, Jian Chen quickly drew out the long sword that had been on his back to his hand
 This double-edged sword was about 1
3 meters long and two fingers wide with a white light
 Stabbing forward with the sword, an even more fierce amount of Sword Qi appeared from the sword and shot towards the jet of Sword Qi from Dugu Qiubai with a speed almost impossible to see with the naked eye
“Bang!”The two rays of Sword Qi collided with a loud explosion that rocked the eardrums
 A large wave of Qi scattered away from the epicenter with great speeds, scattering the lingering wisp of mist and clouds nearby
Straight away, Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai flew straight for each other, leaving the twin peaks they had initially been standing on
 As they reached the midway point of the two peaks, they began to engage each in a fierce battle midair
The two men had strikes that were impeccably fast and the sounds made from their weapons striking against each other had been an endless stream of metallic rings
 A sharp amount of Sword Qi shot out from all directions from the two and left giant holes in the landscape around them
 As a result, countless of rocks had been sent cascading down a thousand meters below
Within several breaths worth of time, Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai had already exchanged several hundred blows at lightning quick speeds
 Afterwards, the two men had leapt back to their respective mountain peaks
 Each person were in a worse-for-wear state and had more than enough tears in their previously perfect clothing
With a serious expression that seemed to grow even more grim each second, Dugu Qiubai growled, “What a fast sword, it is no wonder that no one in the Jianghu is able to break past your sword
 But, it is powerless against this old man
” Dugu Qiubai paused for a moment before continuing to say, “If we continue on like this, the victor of this match will be hard to determine
 We may as well use our strongest strike to find out the victor
” With that, Dugu Qiubai suddenly exploded with power that seemed as if it was a single giant sword that pierced into the skies
Growing serious as well, Jian Chen too began to spike with a large amount of power that was by no means weaker than Dugu Qiubai
The power of the two men continued to escalate with an earth-shattering amount of force that filled the entire area
 Soon enough, the power of the two began to cover the both of them and all over the entire mountains
 Even the clouds themselves had a hole in them from the power exuded by the two
 A fierce gale began to scream and whistle with an ear-piercing sound that was reminiscent of a ghost wailing into the winds
 Down in the forests below, countless of animals began to let out terrified sounds as they began to scuttle away from the area as far as their limbs could take them
 The strength of the two men on the peaks continued to escalate as they prepared to unleash their strongest strike
“Kacha!” “Kacha!”Not too far away in the mountains, several small trees were unable to withstand the power of the two
 Snapping and breaking into several pieces, they were sent flying into the air and far away from the place
While Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai’s strength continued to rise, a stream of Qi began to stream around them in a single revolution
 Any trees or pieces of grass in the area had been pressed down against the ground in the face of their might, and several of the larger trees had even began to shake back and forth
At the same time, a dazzling glow of white light appeared in Jian Chen’s Light Wind Sword while a jet-black light appeared in Dugu Qiubai’s Heavy Iron Sword
The Qi circulating around the two men began to grow stronger and stronger until there was a rich white glow that surrounded Jian Chen completely, and a deep black glow that surrounded Dugu Qiubai inside
 The both of them had disappeared into their respective colors while all that was left to see was two balls of light shining with the exact opposite colors of each other
“Yin!”Jian Chen’s Light Wind Sword had already been filled with a resplendent glow and had started to shake with a powerful Sword Qi that would cause anyone to feel frightened
 His black hair had fluttered crazily in the winds while the white robe he wore fluttered with it
 His entire body floated in midair, and a single look was all it took for him to be identified as a war god with an indomitable strength
As the two men’s strength continued to climb up to the peak, the two men suddenly let out a furious roar that shook the heavens like a bolt of lightning and pierced the ear drums
 Straight away, a beautiful bright white light and a dark black light shot towards each other with incredible speed
 In the instant where the two would collide against each other…There had been no sound as one would expect
 When everything had calmed down, one could see that Jian Chen and Dugu Qiubai had changed spots
 Each one were now on the other mountain peak away from each other with an equally pal face
 A steady stream of blood could be seen flowing from Jian Chen’s chest, staining his pure white robes instantly
 In that split-instance where the two sides had crossed paths, Dugu Qiubai’s sword had pierced through Jian Chen’s heart
As for Dugu Qiubai, he had lost his entire right arm, meaning that he would not be able to wield a sword any longer
 The Heavy Iron Sword that had been in it had long since dropped down a thousand meters into the cliffs below
 At the time where he had pierced Jian Chen’s heart, he had lost his right arm in exchange
Standing silently on top of the mountain peak, a stream of fresh blood began to slowly leak from his mouth
 His white face continued to grow paler and paler before it became as pale as paper
 His heart had been pierced by Dugu Qiubai’s sword, meaning that he was doomed to be stuck in an impasse where death was inevitable
“Hahaha…” Suddenly, Dugu Qiubai began to laugh from the mountain peak he was standing on
 “Jian Chen, with your talent, you would most likely be able to defeat me given several years
 But how unfortunate it is for you that your strength is lacking from mine
 In the end, you were still defeated by my hand
” As he spoke, Dugu Qiubai sighed shortly
 “Ai…for an old man like me to see to the funeral of a genius, what a sorrowful matter
 But however, I must do what I must to avenge my disciple
”Sensing that he was slowly being cut away from the power of life, Jian Chen began to close his eyes
 At that moment, he was at peace with himself
 Death to him was no important manner
 After all, after traveling so many years in the Jianghu, Jian Chen had killed many men and death had long since dulled his emotions
 The only emotion he had felt in his heart was that he would have no more chances to explore the pinnacle of the way of the sword
Just as Jian Chen submitted himself to a realm of calm, a sudden but strange feeling appeared within Jian Chen’s mind
 In that crucial moment, Jian Chen’s spirit seemed to have harmonized with his long sword
 He was the sword, and the sword was him; there had been no difference between the two of them
 It was almost as if the sword had already became a part of his soul
At the same time, a powerful and pure amount of world energy began to descend from the skies before flowing into his mind one stream after another
 As it entered, it began to perfectly harmonize with his soul, and as the energy of the world continued to pour into him, Jian Chen could distinctly feel that his own “spirit” began to grow at an accelerated rate
 Simultaneously, his soul began to leave his body and into the boundless mountains and fields ahead
 At this very moment, everything within five thousand meters could be distinctly seen in Jian Chen’s mind
 He could even see a single mosquito on the ground living as it pleased without a problem
At the verge of his death, he had somehow managed to breakthrough…
