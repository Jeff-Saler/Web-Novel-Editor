“The people of the three great families and the seven giants have come. It seems that there are also associations of the Alchemists and the ten largest chambers of commerce. That thing is definitely not ours!” “But even if we don’t share our insights, This big scene is also good!” There were many discussions in the auction room.“Please take a moment to be a little quiet!” said the young girl auctioneer with a small smile. “We will soon present you with this rare and rare treasure!” At this moment, the auction site quietly fell down.Two beautiful maidens walked up with a plate, something inside the plate, covered with a purple cloth, only vaguely seen a contour"What the hell is it?” “Simply appetite!” At this time the young girl auctioneer showed a charming smile, her right hand pulled and she pulled down the piece of purple bluish ray. In an instant, she could not know how to use it. The black jade pot made of any material appears in front of everyone's eyes. The pot is sparkling and transparent.A stock of soul spirit spread outSeeing this crystal clear black jade pot, Nie can't help but excitement. I never expected to see this thing here. This thing is indeed a rare and rare thing. It cannot be measured by money! "What is the origin of this object, and what purpose it is, it is not even clear to our family. But there is one thing that is certain. The pure soul power that radiates from above fluctuates. It proves that this object is not a generic product, and its bottom is engraved with a nightmare. "The word must have something to do with the nightmare spirit!" The girl auctioneer said, "Continue," according to our homeowners, if we practice the demon spirit around it, we can greatly strengthen the demon spirit, so we can Determined that this is bound to be a rare and wonderful thing. Our family hopes that people with knowledge can play its role!" "The starting price of this item is 8 million demon coins!" The owner of the Red Moon family is not Knowing the role of the black jade pot, so only a low price was opened. If you know the true role of this black jade pot, I am afraid that even selling will not sell it.Just by practicing next to it, you can strengthen the spirit of the spirit. It is worth a lot of money, not to mention its many functions have not yet been developed! The representatives of the various families felt the strong soul power in the air. They could not help moving and became very interested in this black jade pot."What is this black jade pot?" "I don't know, but I'm sure this thing is definitely not simple!" "It's rare, I really want to study it, maybe I have some strange magical use.""Looking at the black jade pot in front of us, Nie can't help but reveal the look of a long-range thought. This black jade pot should be the legendary treasures and treasures, the nightmare of the demon pot, the inheritance of the nightmare pot, and even the wind." Before the Snow Empire, it was said to have been found in an ancient tribeEven Nie Li, only knows a role of the dream of the demon pot, one of the functions of the nightmare pot is to refine the demon! The general process is that when ten different demon spirits are included in the nightmare pot, there is a chance to create a special more powerful demon spirit. If you are lucky, it is possible to get a rare demon spirit. It may also fail. The demon spirit is completely destroyed.The probability of failure is relatively small, and the chance of refining a rare demon spirit is also relatively small. Most of the time, the nightmare monster pot can refine a more incisive demon spirit. This is just enough to make it countless people. Crazy, after all, the vast majority of the demon spirit teacher can only be integrated with a demon spirit, of course, they hope that the only demon spirit stronger the better! With a weak demon spirit, to integrate a powerful demon spirit, this is a dream demon pot! It is estimated that there are not many people who know the role of the nightmare pot.Considering the powerful power of the nightmare pot, Nie decided almost the first moment. No matter how much cost he spent, he would shoot the nightmare pot! Soon, various families began to bid"10 million demon spirit coin!" "Twelve million demon soul coin!" "15 million demon coin!" Soon, the price has risen to more than 20 million demon spirit coin, this price, already It was a shock to people in the auction room."Thirty million demon soul coins!""35 million demon money!" the Association of Alchemists bidNie Lizhao looked at the third floor in the distance. The bid was like Yang Xin. After thinking about it, Nie Lie went to Nie Endao. “Great Elder, Yang Lishi seems to be on the third floor. You can meet Yang Lishi and tell her. This black jade pot I want! Let Yang Senshi help me to make a photo, the money I paid to the Alchemist Association!” Hear Nie Li’s words, but before Nie En answered, Nie Haidao said, “I'll go. !” Nie En’s space ring contained so many immortals. Which dare he let Nie to go? Dignified owner, can only be errands, but he is willing to be willingNie Hai went to find Yang XinThe sacred family and the Association of Alchemists continue to vie for each other. After the Association of Alchemists raised the price to 50 million demon spirits, the sacred family gave up. On the financial strength, even if it was the three great families, it would be impossible to compare them with the Association of Alchemists."Thirty million demon spirits, ah, the Association of Alchemists is really rich and powerful!" "That is of course, the association of the Alchemists recently fired several kinds of immortality, and every day's advances, I am afraid to calculate it in billions!" After a moment, Nie The sea came back and nodded to Nie, saying: "Yang Lishi agreed!" Nie from this request, Yang Xin is absolutely impossible to refuse, after all, Yang Xin still has many things to request to Nie Li.To spend such a small sum of money on the Association of Alchemists is nothing but a lot of money. What Nie Li brings to the Association of Alchemists is not even measured by money.The price has reached the level of 50 million demon soul money, most families do not dare to follow the competition, and many families have to buy the immortality from the Association of Alchemists, so it is still necessary to give the alchemist association some face, although the black Yuhu is a bit covetous, but it doesn’t bid too much.At this moment, a person wearing a grey cloak inside the auction site suddenly started bidding."Whilny five-five million demon soul money?" Who is he, actually someone else is bidding? Everyone in the auction room looked puzzled at the mysterious man wearing a gray cloakGeneral family auction does not need to pay margin. When an ordinary person bids, he must pay enough margin to participate in the auction. The mysterious person actually bids 55 million, which means he must have paid more than fifty-five million guarantees. ! The price of this black jade pot actually rises to such an astonishing degree! So many magic money, is equivalent to the wealth of a noble family! At this time, Yang Xinxiu, who was sitting on the third floor, was in a breeze. In the past few days, she was in the northern part of the Shining City. She was invited by the Red Moon family and participated in the auction. I did not expect Nie to be here.She had originally had some interest in this jade pot, thinking that it was something that was used to make alchemy, and she was thinking of buying it and taking it back to study it.Unexpectedly, Nie Li was also interested in it. Since it was something Nie wanted, the Association of Alchemists had to buy Nie Yi.But after the price was added to the 55 million demon spirit coin, the price was a little out of her expectation, the fifty-five million to buy such a black jade pot that does not know what purpose, in the end worth it? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ !
