Chapter 374 Dragon Emperor
Jian Feng Han coughed and said, “Arguing won’t solve any problems in this battle. Shall we instead have a good discussion about our strategies? What is the overall plan, who do we attack first, who will be the main force and who will be the support; We need to settle all of these details. Chaotic battles without any formations will only put Ba Huang City at a great disadvantage. After all, Jiu Li City’s overall military strength is 10% greater than our own!”
Holding onto his sword, Yan Zhao Warrior smiled and said, “Our biggest concern are the 4 large guilds, [Legend], [House of Prestige], [Judgement] & [Appearance Alliance]. We have to at least get rid of 1 or 2 of these four guilds, if not, they’ll come together, and we’ll be forced into a difficult situation.
Tyrant of Western Chu stepped up with a sword in his hand saying, “Why don’t we attack [Legend] first! In Jiu Li City’s power hierarchy, [House of Prestige], [Judgement] & [Appearance alliance] have clashed swords with them before, so they are certainly not allies. If we all join forces and attack [Legend], we might be able to obliterate them, reducing our concerns.
I pursed my lips and said, “ Those are all just conjectures. The Guild Masters of the few large guilds of Jiu Li City all have relatively high IQ and EQs, Bai Li Ruo Feng, Ye Lai and Mu Xuan are all aware that just like the lips and teeth depend on each other, they are also interdependent. That plan is just too risky.”
Tyrant of Western Chu glared and asked “So Li Xiao Yao, what do you have in mind?”
Jian Feng Han and Yan Zhao Warrior both looked at me, I looked down and said, “Let’s use their grudges. Previously, when I was in Fan Shu City, I killed Quick Thunder Swift Wind, [House of Prestige]’s Vice Guild Master, making the whole alliance hate me to the core. I will take advantage of the chaos, and bring [Zhan Long]’s most agile team to attack [House of Prestige] for a short while, then we’ll retreat. The other remaining guilds will prepare an ambush at a fixed location, first clearing [House of Prestige]’s main offensive strength, once they have lost their main army, [Legend], [Judgment] and the rest will definitely come to their aid. What do you guys think?”
Jian Feng Han Clenched his first and said, “Yes, this plan might work, however, the lands around here are all barren, there doesn’t seem to be any good places for an ambush”
Matcha giggled beside me and said, “That might not necessarily be true. Before coming into the Hell’s Core, I checked the surroundings. Even though it mostly consists of barren lands, 3000 yards east of the Fort Zi Feng, there lies a forest, called Moonlight Forest. It’s highly suitable for ambushes. There’s just one problem, it’s very dangerous for [Zhan Long] if our members are the only ones going to lure the enemies.”
Smiling, Soaring Dragon raised his staff and said “The wolf can’t be caught if we can’t bear to lose a child, these sacrifices are necessary!”
[*TL note: This is an idiom basically meaning ‘sacrifices are inevitable in order to reach your goal’]
Yue Qing Qian rolled her eyes and said “ It’s not like emotions are making Soaring Dragon members become bait, no wonder you seem very calm about it!”
Jian Feng Han said “Knock it off, why don’t we discuss who will be doing the ambush”
Yan Zhao Warrior continued “The ambush team has to be very strong, at the very least it needs to be able to suppress [House of Prestige]’s main force. Prague will send 1000 core members to help, our Vice GM Heaven’s Hero will lead the team while I stay here to defend.”
Jian Feng Hai followed, “[Vanguard will send 2000 men, with Sister Yun* commanding. Xiao Yao Zi Zai do you accept?”
TL Note: Sister Yun is referring to his sister Simple
I nodded and smiled “OK, Since [Vanguard] and [Prague] are so sincere, [Zhan Long] will have General Wang Jian leading 2000 of our elites for the ambush. Misty Cloud what about you guys?”
Misty Cloud laughed aloud, “How about this, I won’t fight here, I’ll go in for the kill. I will be leading 5000 of our elites to assist you, so you will have less worries. Even if [Legend]’s main force attacks us, our military strength will be on par with theirs.”
Han Ben Song followed, “Since we are allies, I will send 3000 of our men, I’m sorry if that’s not enough, as our whole guild only has 5000 members.”
I nodded “Yes, it’s sufficient. While the crowd is still in a state of chaos you guys should discreetly deploy your men to their various positions to avoid being detected by Jiu Li City’s members. If not this plan will fail.”
“OK, Got it!”
……
From the 200,000 men that formed Ba Huang City’s guilds, 20,000 troops swiftly spread out towards Moonlight Forest. With the chain of troops formed by smaller guilds from Ba Huang City, these 20,000 troops were concealed and moved unnoticed. Moreover, Fort Zi Feng acts as a wall between us and Jiu Li City’s camp, making it impossible to see them.
Qing Qian pursed her lips and said “Brother Xiao Yao, I’ll accompany you to lure the enemy. Go gather the troops, how many people should we bring?”
Li Mi explained from the side, “If we have too many, it will scare them, if we have too little, they will feel like there isn’t enough, and that there’s a catch. Therefore, we must be careful with the number.”
I blurted, “1000 men from Zhan Long’s core members should be able to attract [House of Prestige]’s appetite.”
General Wang Jian laughed loudly “Yes, Xiao Yao Brother is right, let it be 1000 men!”
Drawing out the Emperor Qin’s Sword, I faced the highly motivated [Zhan Long]’s members and shouted “ We are setting off now, however we need members who are quick on their feet! Everyone with boots with movement speed +7% move out!”
At that time, about 500+ people moved out!
I followed “Members who are Wind Elves with boots of movement speed +5%, move out!”
Immediately, another 500 members started moving.
I grinned “Good, all of you, do not ask me for our strategy, our objective is to become the bait. Form groups of 10, then every 10 groups form into a platoon and those 10 platoons form into a thousand man battalion. Listen to my commands, whether its to attack or retreat, listen only to me!”
All 1000 of the men drew out their weapons and shouted “ Yes, we obey you Guild Master!”
“Move Out!”
……
As my battle boots tread upon the red ground of the Hell’s Core, I rushed ahead. Behind me, Li Mu, Matcha, Yue Qing Qian, and the rest of the members followed behind. General Wang Jian led 2000 elite members towards Moonlight Forest. There, the two groups split and the remaining people who remained at Fort Zi Feng held on to the ground; these 180,000 people were good enough for a diversion.
The scene ahead of us was bustling as millions of players from both cities were gearing up for war. Under my command, I led 1000 players towards the fortress in the south to the east. Finally, from afar, a sea of red name players from Jiu Li City dotted the map in front of us. There seemed to be no players from [House of Prestige] close by.
“Damn…”
I clenched my fist, “How can this work if there are no [House of Prestige] members…”
Matcha slapped my shoulder and pointed out, “Boss, there is a group of people over there…”
“Ah?”
Everyone looked over and were impressed to see a group of high level players equipped with god like equipments slashing down members of Ba Huang City as they rushed towards the city war point. All of these players had the same insignia on their arm, a blood red sword. They were Jiu Li City’s 6th strongest guild – [Emperor’s Blood].
Matcha slowly replied “[Emperor’s Blood]’s Guild Master Dragon Emperor is said to be good friends with Quick Thunder Swift Wind, therefore [Emperor’s Blood] and [House of Prestige] are alliance brothers. How about we lure out [House of Prestige] by using [Emperor’s Blood]?”
My heart leapt at the chance, “Hm, ok!”
I raised my Emperor Qin’s Sword and shouted, “ Follow me, our target is [Emperor’s Blood], they only have 500+ players. Obliterate them!”
As I spoke, I dashed forward as my Flaming Tiger God roared. I then opened my hand and targeted an Archer from [Emperor’s Blood] with [Great Realm of Desolation]. One hit KO!
“4721！”
“叮！”
System Notification: You have killed the player [Emperor Ao Gu] and have achieved 10 War Points!
……
As we were engaged in battle, General Li Mu held his sword and fought along side me. With a swing of his sword, his [Combo] was activated, killing a Knight immediately. Without delay, he raised his sword again towards a group of Healers and started slashing. With a roar, he instantly killed 7 to 8 players. This offensive strength was worthy of being placed within Ba Huang City’s top 10.
Qing Qian lightly dashed forward, “Cha Cha”, in a blink of an eye, she killed a couple of players with her daggers. In sync with my [Seven Star Fragment Slash], Qing Qian’s [Grip of the Firefox] raged into the crowd, and [Emperor’s Blood] members were dropping like flies.
“Guild Master”
As a captain was frantically trying to retreat, he shouted “ Guild Master, It’s [Zhan Long], It’s [Zhan Long]! Xiao Yao Zi Zai, Yue Qing Qian, General Li Mu are all here, [Zhan Long]’s core members are all here!”
From the rear of the crowd, a Knight clad in Gold Tier equipment with a lance in his hand rushed forward with a beast by his side, his face filled with anger “What is happening, why is [Zhan Long]’s main force charging at us!”
Above his head a line of words could be seen prominently—
Dragon Emperor LV-70 Gold Knight
City: Jiu Li City
Guild: Emperor’s Blood
Position: Guild Master
……
Dragon Emperor roared out and charged at General Li Mu. When he lunged forward, his lance shook from the strength of his thrust! General Li Mu parried the attack, “Dang”, sparks flew. He was actually being pushed back!?
Qing Qian spoke in the team channel “Be careful, Dragon Emperor is Jiu Li City’s number 1 Knight, with over 3400 Defence points and 2800+ damage points. On top of that, his health is over ten thousand!”
“A 10,000 health Knight?!” Li Mu hastily retreated, he only had 5000 health points and couldn’t afford to be reckless.
“Leave it to me!”
Tightly gripping onto the Emperor Qin’s Sword, I dashed forward, intercepting the hunt between Dragon Emperor and General Li Mu. My Emperor Qin’s Sword flashed and an 8 hit [Combo] continuously hit Dragon Emperor’s shoulder. Sparks flew with each hit.
“787！”
“873！”
“775！”
“833！”
Indeed, his defenses were really strong!
Dragon Emperor growled “ Xiao Yao Zi Zai, you came just in right time!”
“Hua!”
As his lance swept at me, I couldn’t help but smile. I then pulled out my Cold Iron Sword and angrily hacked at him. “Kang”, I pushed his lance back, taking the chance to pull myself closer to him as well. I raised my boots and delivered a kick right into Dragon Emperor’s stomach. Suddenly, sounds of thunder began to boom as cyclones gathered around my blade. Five lighting slashes struck the Dragon Emperor’s chestplate. This health Knight was left with only 2k health.
In one hand, I started to gather energy for [Great Realm of Desolation]!
I deliberately released the skill slowly. Dragon Emperor jumped back to retreat, his face ashen. He activated [Cleansing Wind] to recover 3000 hp as he jumped back to dodge [Great Realm of Desolation]. Gritting his teeth, Dragon Emperor shouted, “Xiao Yao Za Zai, you win for now but just you wait!”
I didn’t bother to respond. Instead, I placed my Cold Iron Sword back in it’s sheath, then raised my Emperor Qin’s Sword and shouted, “Obliterate all players from [Emperor’s Blood]!!”
……
Qing Qian squinted and smiled sweetly, “Whoa, Brother Xiao Yao is so smart, you’ve inconspicuously diverted all the hatred towards us”
Song Han smiled and said, “Now we wait for this faux battle!”
