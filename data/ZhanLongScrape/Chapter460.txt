Chapter 460 Q-Sword’s Empty City Plan
On the map, all I saw were rows and rows of red dots in front of us. I had already listed [Hero’s Mound] as an enemy guild, and all of their dots on the map would become a stronger red. It was clear, Q-Sword was planning on ambushing us here. Unfortunately, there were too many players, and some of them weren’t even completely covered.
“What should we do?”
Li Mu gripped gripped his longsword and said, “There are definitely people in those forests ahead. However, we have to go through that area to get to Desolate Cloud Swamp. Should we really go though….. if we don’t, I’m afraid that [Vanguard] and [Enemies at the Gate] are going to lose though!”
Qing Qian’s beautiful eyes turned to me as she said, “After some discussion, Jian Feng Han and Misty Clouds have stopped fighting. However, they are going to keep up the appearance that they are still fighting. The two want to utilize that trick to lure [Hero’s Mound] to attack. Afterwards, they’ll join us, [Zhan Long], and ambush them from three sides. Hopefully we can crush [Hero’s Mound]’s strength.”
Wolf raised a fist, “But there’s an ambush in front of us. If we were to enter it, then we’ll take substantial losses. That’s [Hero’s Mound] out there, they aren’t trash like [Flying Dragon]…”
I took a deep breath and nodded, “Yup. But everyone, don’t get too excited. Send out a team of Wind Elves to scout out ahead!”
“Yup!”
……
The sound of wings flapped as a dozen of [Zhan Long]’s Wind Elves raised their bows and flew away as they split up and entered into the forest.
“Huh?”
One of the Wind Elves suddenly stopped flying and opened up her long bow. She then shot an arrow into the forest. “Sou!”, there was no movement after the arrow flew in. However, after a few seconds, an angry bellow sounded out. A brawny man carrying a battle axe charged out from the trees. He raised his battle axe and unleashed a [Battle Axe Throw]!
“Pa…..”
Our Wind Elf fell with a soft grunt. The Berserker leapt up and threw another [Skyshaker Slash], and turned the Wind Elf into a corpse.
In the other direction, the sounds of agonized screams rose up. A few of our Wind Elf Knights had been made into porcupines from a barrage of arrows, and their blood rained onto the ground. In a blink of an eye, all of the people that [Zhan Long] sent out were dead on the ground. They didn’t even see the enemy, much less get intel on where the enemy was lying in ambush.
……
“F*ck….” Li Mu’s face was ashen. He swung his blade out and said, “They’re just too savage. The ambush lying in wait in the forest must be [Hero’s Mound]’s main force. Guild Master, I’ll take a 500 man team to check them out. If it really is their main force, then we’ll retreat and you guys follow up from behind!”
I raised my hand to stop him, “No, I’ll take people! You hold our formation here. That way, I can at least ensure that I’ll be able to fully retreat. Li Mu, you’re the linchpin of the Valiant Bravery Camp. I can’t just watch you die in some no name forest.”
After I finished, I looked towards One Second Hero, “Cheng Yong Jie, take your 500 man team and follow me!”
One Second Hero raised his halberd and nodded, “Understood!”
Very soon, 500 people appeared. Under my command, they all charged forward. I relied on my advantage in movement speed to run at the very front the team. In reality, this was also to concentrate all of the firepower on myself, that way, we could take less losses. With a roar, my Flaming Tiger God was summoned from the pet dimension. It waved its claws as it reared up and pounced out.
“Sha sha….”
Right in front of us, the bushes began to rustle. Without skipping a heartbeat, I opened my palm and sent a [Great Realm of Desolation!]
“Peng!”
“5423！”
One of the Swordsmen cried out in pain and fell into a pile of bodies. At the same time, “Shua Shua Shua”, seven to eight arrows shot out from a pile of leaves. I quickly slid to the side to dodge as my War Swept Cloak fluttered behind me. One after another, they all missed their target. I came to a halt with my Cloud Stepping Boots. My Dragon Reservoir Sword slightly jolted as seven stars began to move. My [Seven Star Fragment Slash] smashed through the forest, and a chain of damage numbers flew up.
“6012！”
“5983！”
“6237！”
……
My attack power was just too high. Almost everyone that had gotten hit was killed. I used [Haste], and lunged forward. Unexpectedly, a “Pa Ta” sounded out as I passed through the grass. A [Beast Trap] locked onto my feet. It was a fourth advancement Archer skill. The effect lasts for 3 seconds.
The bushes in front of me rustled and the smell of gunpowder filled my nose. “Peng Peng Peng!”, a fiery bullet smacked against my Wall of Dou Qi. It was the Musketeer’s fourth advancement skill——[Magma Bullet]. It increases attack power by 150%, and has the effect of breaking through original defense. As expected, my 5000 base defense was broken from this skill——
“1092！”
“978！”
“1127！”
……
After three seconds, I used [Haste] and turned around. I opened up my palm, and commanded [Soul Army] to descend upon the forest. One after another, the skill crushed the crowd of Musketeers, and screams of fear rang out. I retreated several steps before another “Ka Cha!” sound rang out. I was trapped by another Archer’s [Beast Trap].
“Guild Master, be careful!” Behind me, one of the Mages raised her staff and let out a [Revealing Light]. In a loud voice, she said, “There are definitely quite a few [Beast Traps] laid out here!”
Just as expected, under the light of the spell, countless [Beast Trap]’s appeared in the bushes. Motherf*cker, it was terrifying. There were at least a thousand in that forest. This meant that there were over a thousand Archers there to set up that ambush.
I lunged forward and cut down a [Beast Trap]. I then shouted, “Continue casting [Revealing Light], we’ll clear out all of the [Beast Traps] in the area!”
“Ok!”
Everywhere, we cut apart the [Beast Traps] that the [Revealing Light] illuminated, but there wasn’t any movement from the bushes, which made me suspicious. What exactly was Q-Sword planning, and why wasn’t he stopping us? Maybe…… Maybe these were just some fake soldiers, and they’re purposely luring us into a trap?
Behind me, Qing Qian’s voice rang, “Brother Xiao Yao, new intel. There are at least 20,000 [Hero’s Mound] players that have appeared in Desolate Cloud Swamp. They’re attacking [Vanguard] and [Enemies at the Gate] right now! They’re around 1300 yards ahead of us!”
“F*ck!”
I gritted my teeth and raised my Dragon Reservoir Sword, “All of [Zhan Long]’s players listen to me. No matter if there is or isn’t an ambush in those bushes, we’re going to charge right through! Kill!”
Li Mu questioned, “Eh? Aren’t you afraid of an ambush?”
“There’s won’t be, there isn’t even a heavy army ambush here!” I gritted my teeth and said, “At most, there isn’t more than 1000 people here. They’re just here to delay us for a whole 20 minutes. Q-Sword has already reached his target. All members, advance! Enter the Desolate Cloud Swamp, the battle is right ahead of us!”
“Yes sir!”
[Zhan Long]’s main guild and divisions all advanced. Just as expected, there were only several hundred people lying in wait in the bushes. They were all killed by us as we advanced forward. Within 10 minutes, we passed through the forest!
“Hua….”
When I hacked my way through the bramble, a flash of light suddenly passed by my eyes. Just ahead of me, there was a moist swamp. At that moment, the swamp was filled with players. [Enemies at the Gate] and [Vanguard] were both attacking on the northern side of the swamp, while [Hero’s Mound]’s countless players were currently fiercely charging forward. In the distance, I could see Q-Sword’s silhouette. He was swinging his blade and slaughtering Ba Huang City players. He was practically a killing machine!
……
I pointed my Dragon Reservoir Sword right at [Hero’s Mound]’s rear and bellowed, “Advance!”
Li Mu, Wang Jian, and Old K all rushed forward. Matcha stayed by my side to shield me and raised her sword, and blinked a few times, “Boss, [Hero’s Mound] has sent people to block our troops….. Wu, it’s Cang Cheng’s First Division, and Divisions 11, 13, 17, and 18. There’s around 5000 players….”
I pointed forward and shouted, “Brothers of [Zhan Long], cut them down!”
Wang Ze Cheng raised his Flames of War Magic Blade and stood at the frontlines. He suddenly retreated a step, and an enormous shield blocked our first Swordsman on the frontlines. He then sent his Flames of War blade out, and “Ka Cha!” dealt 4100 damage. He actually managed to instantly kill a Lv 80 Fourth Advancement Swordsman. That bastard’s attack power is terrifying.
Dong Cheng Lei roared and suddenly charged forward. He raised his battle axe, and “Peng!” he smashed into Wang Ze Cheng’s shield. The force of the attack forced Wang Ze Cheng to retreat several steps. His face turned ugly, “Cang Lei, you!”
“F*ck off! You aren’t fit to have “Cang” in your name!”
Dong Cheng Lei snarled and swept out his battle axe, and forced Wang Ze Cheng back even further. However, Wang Ze Cheng was an extremely smart person and let his feet slide backwards and he made a quick retreat, as he dodged Qing Qian’s [Grip of the Firefox] and Li Mu’s [Covering Sword Slash]. Afterwards, he hid behind the first row and stopped attracting all of the firepower. It was as if he realized that there was quite a number of people that wanted to kill him in [Zhan Long].
My two swords terrorized the frontlines. My Cold Iron Sword and Dragon Reservoir Sword were covered in blood, while my Flaming Tiger God lunged forward and its body was covered with [Flame Armor] and activated [Burstfire Raid] in the middle of the crowd. The sight of him roaring was an iconic scene on [Zhan Long]’s battlefields. A gale swept through the crowds as Old K’s [Whirlwind Blade] cut through the crowd. Li Mu and Wang Jian both activated [Flying Sword] and their blades cut into the crowds, while blood sprayed everywhere. The entire battlefield was dyed red.
“Hong hong hong….”
Suddenly, small volcanoes began to pop up throughout the marsh. Thousand Suns over Snowy Lands lead a group of [Zhan Long]’s Mages and continuously cast [Magma Abyss]. The players of [Hero’s Mound] still recklessly countered our attacks. Wang Ze Cheng lead the attack, and all of the players did their best to throw themselves at [Zhan Long]’s frontline. It was very clear, Q-Sword gave them a kamikaze command. It was probably something along the lines of, no matter what you do, you have to delay [Zhan Long] for an hour, or half an hour.
……
In the distance, there was suddenly the sound of a charge rang out throughout the swamp, and resonated in my heart!
“Matcha!”
I looked at my beautiful Elder and said, “Quick, fly up and tell me the situation!”
“Yes sir!”
Matcha’s small boots stomped against the ground, and she flew up. Her two snow white legs appeared in front of everyone’s eyes. I also saw what she saw, and noticed a group of countless players charging through the northern forest. They were all [Hero’s Mound]’s players. Q-Sword’s sister Sword Tears, a top tier fourth advancement Swordsman, lead the troops.
Qing Qian’s voice trembled, “Oh no…. there’s another 30,000 of [Hero’s Mound]’s troops that are returning here. They weren’t headed towards the City of the Four Noblemen, they were going to surround [Vanguard] and [Enemies at the Gate]…”
I tightened my grip on my two swords and suddenly hacked my way through the crowd as I shouted, “Believe in our allies to hold off the enemy. [Enemies at the Gate] and [Vanguard] aren’t made of soft meat, they’ll rip out some of [Hero’s Mound]’s teeth. Within 20 minutes, we must annihilate [Hero’s mound: Division One] and charge all the way to the rear of their main force! Let them have a taste of defeat before they leave!”
