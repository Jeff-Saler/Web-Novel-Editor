Chapter 382 The Crops are Ripe
When Snow Wolf died, the frontline of [House Of Prestige] became agitated. In addition, the AOE skills of Li Mu, Old K and the others swept past, and the first 500 people of the 3000 man army were mostly killed. The collapse of the frontline spread towards the back like an epidemic. A fundamental change was finally triggered. [House Of Prestige]’s right wing team began facing a landslide defeat!
“Kill!”
I crossed my Emperor Qin’s Sword and Cold Iron Sword as I swept through the players at an incredibly fast speed. My Flaming Tiger God roared furiously and jumped into the midst of the crowds like it had entered a desolate area. None of the other pets could fight the Flaming Tiger God. For instance, even if ten ordinary pets like mantises and bees were to be added together in term of strength, they wouldn’t be able to compete against Flaming Tiger God. The gap between their strength is too big!
……
As I charged forward, I sent a message to Piggy, “We, [Zhan Long], have already killed 4000 of [House of Prestige]’s close-combat players. How’s your situation?”
Piggy hastily replied, “It’s not looking good. Bai Li Ruo Feng and Ye Lai have brought 10,000 men, and they are practically hacking us to pieces! Their strength is just way way too great. I don’t think [Wrath of the Heroes] can withstand anymore. Guild Master repeatedly told me to retreat. Guild Master Xiao Yao, I’m really sorry, but [Wrath of the Heroes] must retreat now, or else we’ll truly be annihilated!”
I nodded, “Yeah, then let’s retreat! [Enemies At The Gate] and [Crimson Contract] should be annihilating all members of [Emperor’s Blood] soon!”
“Okay. We are backing out!”
In the distance, the [Wrath of the Heroes] players all quickly retreated. They moved towards the other side of the plain. When they came, they were 20,000 strong, but when they left, they were a mere 5000 man team. This just proved how terrifying [Judgement] and [House of Prestige] were. They were practically two massive killing machines!
……
“Boss!” Matcha exclaimed, “[Wrath of the Heroes] was utterly defeated! Bai Li Ruo Feng brought the true elites from [House of Prestige] to fight the decisive battle. Why don’t we retreat… [Zhan Long]’s losses were also great. If we fight another battle head on, then all of our men would die!”
“Yes!”
I pointed to the south with my sword and said, “Go towards the south, and attack as we move forward!”
“Alright!”
Li Mu, Wang Jian, Yue Qing Qian and the others commanded everyone to retreat. Meanwhile, Bai li Ruo Feng led a group of [House Of Prestige]’s main forces to pursue us fiercely. The pursuing team consisted of Swordsmen, Berserkers, Mages and Archers. Therefore, their movement speed was extremely fast, and they were about to catch up!
“PaPaPa……”
His leather boots sliding across the sand, Bai Li Ruo Feng was the first to arrive. He pulled 20 yards closer, and had already got into the most advantageous position. He immediately halted, then activated [Electrical Star Shot], increasing his attack speed. It was almost as though the process of positioning the bow had been completely neglected, as he rapidly fired seven to eight arrows. Five of [Zhan Long]’s players in the back row cried out as they crumpled to the ground. Following that, Bai Li Ruo Feng sent out a [Big Dipper Meteor]. The skill cut through the crowd, and killed seven people before burying itself into the back of One Second Hero!
“Peng!”
“3717！”
One Second Hero’s entire body shook from the impact. He immediately picked up his long spear and roared out, “Bai Li Ruo Feng, you bastard! I won’t let you kill so many of my people. I’m going to go teach you a lesson!”
Raising my sword, I quickly retreated and yelled out, “One Second Hero you dumbass there’s no f*cking way for you to kill him. Get your ass out of there! You can strike back when you meet up with [Enemies at the Gate] and [Blood Contract]! I’ll go block Bai Li Ruo Feng! ”
“But Boss!”
“No buts, leave!”
“Ok!”
……
Watching One Second Hero leave, I immediately held up my two swords and leapt at Bai Li Ruo Feng. His movement speed was extremely quick, and he soon pulled 30 yards away from me. Once he noticed me his face broke into a smile, “Xiao Yao Zi Zai, perfect timing! I was just thinking of dueling you. Come at me, let me see just how talented you really are, as you dared to kill so many of my people!”
I didn’t say anything. Instead, I rushed out and charged straight at Bai Li Ruo Feng!
Bai Li Ruo Feng raised his longbow. The terrifyingly accurate attack was coming again! “Shua Shua Shua” three arrows shot out. I only manage to dodge one of them!
“1938！”
“1922！”
It was just too painful. I gulped down a health potion, and kept trying to pull closer!
“Ha!”
When we were only 15 yards apart, Bai Li Ruo Feng immediately raised his long bow, [Silencing Arrow]! I couldn’t get hit by this, or else I wouldn’t be able to use any skills for 2.5 seconds; my fate would be sealed then!
I ducked down, and used my [Blade Rush] to dodge the [Silencing Arrow]. This way he was also within my range of attack! I raised my Emperor Qin’s Sword and activated [Seven Star Fragment Slash]!
Once my [Seven Star Fragment Slash] left my blade, Bai Li Ruo Feng suddenly activated another attack —— [Lightning Tempest]! A impenetrable tempest appeared before me, blocking my [Seven Star Fragment Slash]. Closely following that, he sent out another arrow through the tempest, forcing his body to bounce backwards. What an effective combo!
I endured the pain of the arrow pierced in my chest, and activated a [God Army Card] in my hand. [Seven Stars Teleportation] activated, giving me free reign to teleport to any point in the seven star placement. “Shua!” I teleported to the Tian Quan Position and swung my blade, casting a [Combo]!
“Huh?!”
Bai Li Ruo Feng’s heart froze. He immediately cast [Crystallize]!
“MISS！”
The second [Crystallize] was about to end, I lunged forward with a stab!
“Keng!”
What surprised me was that he used his steel bow to block the attack. Even though he couldn’t completely block the attack, his body flew backwards from the impact of the attack. Miserably, he fell onto the ground. Looking up, all he could see was my arm gathering the power of the dragon!
“Oh no!”
[Defeat the Dragon] activated and Bai Li Ruo Feng was bound by the dragon chains and dragged right to me. I swung my Emperor Qin’s Sword with my right hand, as it shined with the effect of [Wind Blade]. With just one attack, I could pretty much kill this [House of Prestige] Guild Master!
……
“Keng!”
Everything weighed on this moment and I was stunned. Motherf*cker, who would’ve thought that I would get stunned at this moment! One of the remaining [House of Prestige] Archers caught up to us!
Bai Li Ruo Feng, still in a state of panic, immediately raised his battle bow, and shot three arrows in a row!
“Pa pa pa…..”
My health dropped to the bottom. Fortunately, the Archer that stunned me wasn’t very strong, so the effect period was very short. Once I recovered, I immediately activated [Shield of the Crimson Dragon], and threw a [Wind Blade] at Bai Li Ruo Feng. By then, he had already prepared himself for the attack!
“Keng!”
The strong skill hit against Bai Li Ruo Feng’s bow, forcing him so far backwards it was like he was kiting. Battered, he fell to the ground while I simply opened my hand —— [Great Realm of Desolation]!
I didn’t even check to see if the [Great Realm of Desolation] took his life. Instead, I held up my sword and immediately retreated. The players from [House of Prestige] had all caught up to us, but all of [Zhan Long]’s players had successfully retreated. My task was complete. While I was running, I toggled my viewpoint to behind me. Just as I expected, Bai Li Ruo Feng rolled away, causing the [Great Realm of Desolation] to MISS. He escaped again!
Although I did not manage to kill this Guild Master, that was enough as I have embarrassed him in front of so many [House Of Prestige]’s players. I had achieved my goal, and shocked the hearts of the [House Of Prestige]’s players to a certain point. It was to tell them that [Zhan Long] was not to be trifled with, and that it would not be difficult if I wanted to kill Bai Li Ruo Feng!
……
When we returned to our position using [Haste], we found out that the [Enemies At The Gate] and [Blood Contract] alliance were already battling with [Judgement]!
Ye Lai lifted his battle axe and was locked in a fierce battle with Misty Cloud, yet he was constantly forced to back away due to the harassment of Han Bei Song’s [Blade Rush]. With a raise of his battle axe, he bellowed loudly, “We can’t rely on [House Of Prestige] anymore. All of [Judgement] retreat immediately. [Zhan Long] has returned. If we don’t leave now, we will definitely suffer losses!”
I raised my sword from afar and laugh out loud, “Ye Lai, goodbye!”
“Bye!”
Holding up his battle axe, Ye Lai led over ten thousands [Judgement] players and disappeared into the clouds of smoke. There were only piles of corpses, equipment, potions, cards, etc left on the ground. This city war was so intense that every part of the battlefield was horrifying.
……
“Clean the battlefield!” I gave the command. “We can’t lose out on things like this, since [Zhan Long] is also a major force in the battle. ”
Carrying his sword, Misty Cloud walked over here as a stern expression filled his face, “Ye Lai is truly very strong. Even though I changed class to Four Divine Symbols Guardian , I still did not gain any advantages. Instead, there were a few times that I almost got killed by him……”
I nodded, “The 11th place of the CBN Battle Net isn’t just for show.”
“Yup!”
Behind me, Sister Matcha walked attractively towards me. I then asked her, “Has the rate of battle damage been calculated?”
Matcha pursed her red lips and answered, “Yeah, 5100+ people went and 1400+ died. Now there are around 3700 people left. Boss……if a head-to-head big battle happens again, I am afraid we will be wiped out……”
I remained silent.
By my side, Misty Cloud patted my shoulder and said, “Making [Zhan Long] painstakingly face guilds like [House Of Prestige] has really made things difficult for you guys……”
Lifting my head up, I looked at him in the eyes. and declared with a faint smile, “It’s alright! No matter how strong the opponents we face now are, we will possess that same strength in the future.”
“Yeah. Great speech! Now what?”
……
I turned and gazed at the battlefield from afar and said, “Check how much health the All Terrain army’s BOSS, Qin Hai, has now. When he has only 5% of his health remaining, send the people from our group out and slay this BOSS. We might obtain some nice experience, equipment or something. This chance must not go to waste. Since our probability of winning in this city war isn’t very high, we must take whatever the benefits we can get.”
“Yeah!”
In the distance, the battle between the NPCs was reaching an end. Large amounts of the cavalry from both Ba Huang City and Jiu Li City became corpses, and the area under the city turned into a pool of blood. Facing the city war, the major armed forces of Ba Huang City were attacking the city walls as corpses lay all over the area. The ruler of Ba Huang City, Luo Lei, had personally come to supervise the battle, while Angela of Han Bing Army was sent here to guard the west side of the city.
“Honk honk honk……”
Qin Hai was breathing very heavily as the long sword in his hand trembled slightly while only 11% of his health was left. Right in front of him was Moon Elf Princess Angela who still had 37% of health. Her pretty face was marked with bloodstains, and her chest heaved rapidly while her battle robe was already colored red with blood. She spoke in an indifferent tone, “Qin Hai, the All Terrain Army has already been terminated. Heh heh……. The army you are so proud of has been wiped out. What other cards do you have left?”
Qin Hai’s eyes were filled with flames of anger and he exclaimed, “Angela, You bitch! Even if the All Terrain Army collapses, I will definitely bury your Han Feng Army along with my them! You wait and see! Lord Huo Li and Lord Lin Qiong will avenge me!”
Farther away, Angela opened her hand, and the wind circulated around her. With a “Peng” sound, [Wind Cone] bombarded Qin Hai’s chest and Angela said with a faint smile, “You are already at death’s door. Die!”
……
“Keng!”
I drew out my Emperor Qin’s Sword as I laughed out loud, “The crops are ripe. Brothers, come harvest with me. Qin Hai’s head belongs to us!”
