Chapter 512 Sad News
“Keng!”
Standing at the front row, I raised my arm and pulled out my Dragon Reservoir Sword and smiled, “Pull back. Let’s maintain a 30 yard distance between us and the enemy lines. Make sure to control your firepower. We’re going to trap them here, and continuously whittle away at their ten thousand man army. Let’s show those people from [Vanguard] what tactics truly are!”
In the front, Leafy Gentleman and Don’t Be Foolish all brought several thousand players our way. However, with a cliff on their right and a thorny forest on their left, they could only charge at our front. However, our defense formation was just too strong, with Matcha, One Second Hero, and Tang Xin, those top tier Knights all in one place, as well as Old K, Star Blade, Moon Feather, Wan Er and I. There was a total of 30 people on our frontlines and they were all top level players that could hold off ten+ people. Furthermore, we had Darling Duck and Thousand League Spring, and more behind us to heal. Even better was our DPS players Dong Cheng, Dancing Forest and Thousand Suns over Snowy Lands. With a team like this, just think how OP can we be!
……
“Prepare to use [Bombardment]!” Fox commanded. Gunshots filled the air and a dozen Musketeers shot at the same time. That attack, alongside a dozen [Artillery] skills filled the battlefront with smoke and gunpowder, while several dozen of [Vanguard]’s players died.
“Ram into the formation!”
Don’t Be Foolish raised his long spear and “Peng!” Rammed into Tang Xin’s heavy shield. He then raised it and dealt a [Flame Blade]. However, before the spear even fell upon her, he saw the beautiful face behind the shield and suddenly jolted, “What a cute beauty….”
Tang Xin didn’t say a word and abruptly pushed her shield into Don’t Be Foolish’ face. She then swung her long sword and “Ka Ka” forced Don’t Be Foolish to retreat several steps. Dancing Forest then shot an arrow right into his forehead, while Qing Qian threw a [Grip of the Firefox]. All he could do was retreat with his critical health. That [Meteor Shot] arrow still flashed in his behind.
Leafy Gentleman cast a [Flying Sword] from a distance that pierced into my chest plate. Right afterwards he yelled, “Mages, advance with us and kill them all with [Magma Abyss]! Musketeers, use [Artillery], don’t play nice!”
As soon as his command fell, several miniature volcanoes exploded under my feet. However, I activated [Flame Prison Armor] increasing everyone’s fire resistance by 50%, making it so that the [Magma Abyss]es only dealt 500-1200 damage. It was nothing critical. Furthermore, Simple that superior Mage had not yet joined in.
Dong Cheng and Dancing Forest took the chance to deal damage on the enemy’s long range team. Spells and arrows killed countless people, while we had suffered very little losses. This made Leafy Gentleman’s face turn uglier and uglier.
……
“Knights and Monks, charge forward! Switch to attacking more often! Let’s whittle them away little by little!”
Under Leafy Gentleman’s command, numerous heavy armor players all sprinted towards us. They were basically all Knights and Monks that had at least ten thousand health. No matter how strong [Zhan Long]’s attack was, there was no way we could instantly kill so many people. There were around a hundred of them and they quickly broke through the firenet. “Peng peng peng!” They rammed into [Zhan Long]’s heavy shield formation.
I swept out my blade and continuously hacked forward, letting blood spurt out. My [Sword Tempest] steadily leveled up as well. Whenever the cool down finished, I would immediately activate it. Bringing it to Lv 10 was the true way of the king! That way the attack power would be even higher!
In the next moment however, a dozen fourth advancement Swordsman, including Leafy Gentleman, all activated [Flying Sword]. All of the swords’ energy was focused on Star Blade and several [Indigo Sea Arrow]s fell onto Star Blade’s Garrison Armor Chest plate. In the blink of an eye, Star Blade grunted and fell to his knees. Even a ten thousand health player couldn’t take that kind of an attack.
So, Leafy Gentleman’s tactic, was to kill us off one by one?!
The enemy Mages were no longer using [Magma Abyss] as they found out how strong our fire resistance was. Instead they used [Indigo Sea Arrow], a super explosive solo attack spell. Using that along with [Skyshaker Slash] and [Flying Sword] they targeted us one by one. [Zhan Long]’s frontline players all died one by one. Soon, of the Garrison Outfit heavy armor players, seven or eight of them had already died. This was a great loss for us.
“What do we do? Are we just going to watch as everyone gets killed off?” Old K said, his eyes widened.
I gritted my teeth, “Is there any other way? Let’s just do our best to deal damage. For every person they kill, we’ll kill ten of theirs! All frontline players be careful you don’t get targeted. Healers, you watch too, and save those [Grip of Compassion]s!”
……
We kept taking losses like this, and after two hours of fierce battling, finally, we were down to only around 1000 players. [Vanguard: Division One] had also been whittled away by us. Within those two hours, [Zhan Long] had killed at least 7000 of [Vanguard]’s players. I could tell in the distance that there weren’t many left from [Enemies at the Gate] either. At the moment, they had around 3000, while [Vanguard]’s main guild and its first division only had around 15,000 people still left. This was far beyond Jian Feng Han and Simple’s expectations. After being held up by [Zhan Long], [Enemies At the Gate] had killed far too many of their players!
“Sha sha…”
Simple raised her staff and slowly walked over with a cruel smile, “Looks like we’re gonna have to burn our boats and deal one last attack. Fallen Wolf, bring 3000 players from the main guild and prepare to send Xiao Yao Zi Zai and [Zhan Long] on its last journey. No matter how many losses we have to take, kill Xiao Yao Zi Zai and Cang Tong. With that, we’ll have won this battle!”
Fallen Wolf nodded, “Alright! Big shots, get ready to charge with me!”
Goodbye Tears raised his blade, “No problem!”
……
On [Zhan Long]’s formation, everyone’s armor and blades were starting to break down. Even my Cold Iron Sword only had around 7% durability left and my helmet was on the verge of breaking. Moon Feather, Tang Xin, and Winter Snow were all covered in blood and cuts. This battle was just too fierce.
Wan Er stood beside me, the Dragon’s Kiss dagger in her hand still dripping with blood. She wasn’t even sure how many she had killed, and she was starting to breathe harder. I could see the two full mounds on her chest rising and falling. She turned around to look at me, her beautiful eyes filled with doubt, “Yo, if we keep this up, then we’ll all die….”
I nodded, “Yup, but I wasn’t planning on fighting them head on….”
“Why?”
I smiled and then rested my arm on Wan Er’s thin shoulder and smiled, “Because our goal is already finished. We’ve already dealt with 70% of [Vanguard]’s power. They have no way of completely crushing [Zhan Long] anymore. Retreat. With just 15,000 men they can’t do anything!”
Qing Qian blinked a few times, “Brother Xiao Yao, where are we retreating to?”
I turned around and looked at the Glacial River Valley and said, “We’ll retreat on the thick ice. If we go straight south from the Glacial River Valley and meet up with the Valiant Bravery Camp. F*ck, we took too many losses though….”
Qing Qian gave a sympathetic smile, “Yup…..”
“Wan Er, immediately take everyone to retreat, I’ll bring up the rear!” I said as I raised my Dragon Reservoir Sword.
Wan Er didn’t say anything else and turned around. The Zhan Long camp’s 1000 surviving players all immediately sprinted towards the layer of ice. Right now there isn’t any giant dragon to ram into the ice, and so we didn’t have to worry about it breaking under our feet. Like that, I stood on my own before the enemy lines and looked at Simple with a smile on my face.
“Retreating?” Simple asked with a raised eyebrow.
Fallen Wolf said, “Then what do we do? Pursue?”
Simple shook her head, “No. Did you forget about how [Legend] suffered a crushing defeat? Even Fang Ge Que had been defeated by him here. That person is just too smart. Let’s not follow in the path of the defeated…”
“Alright!”
I turned around to leave. “Di!” I received a message from Simple, “Li Xiao Yao, I can only help you to here. [Vanguard] attacking [Zhan Long] was not something that I could decide on, however, I can leave you with some remaining strength. To be honest, I don’t support [Vanguard] remaining an enemy of [Zhan Long], do you understand?”
I smiled and replied, “Yup. However, [Zhan Long] has never actively acted against [Vanguard]. You should know that better than anyone else. Go persuade your brother. This is a virtual game. When people die, they’ll still revive. Just killing me doesn’t mean that he’ll be able to crush [Zhan Long] and become the king of Ba Huang City. The true power of games comes from the fact that we can all strengthen ourselves without the fear of dying.”
“Understood, thank you….”
“I should be the one to say thank you. I hope that next time we meet, it won’t be under such circumstances….”
“I hope so too!”
“Mhm!”
……
On the thick ice, I caught up with the team that Wan Er lead. At the same time, I opened up the chat to understand the battle situation ——
I asked, “Li Mu, Wang Jian, what’s the situation like on the Valiant Bravery side? How many people do you have left?”
Li Mu said, “The battle was extremely fierce. The [Knights Templar] and [Fantasy Kingdom] all fought with us at least once. Afterwards, they weren’t able to take our place and instead took their 10,000 people to scurry back to Fan Shu City. We lost quite a few people on our side. Other than the 1000 people from the Zhan Long Camp, the entire guild only has 4000 people. In other words, [Zhan Long] still has 5000 people to use!”
Wang Jian asked, “Brother Xiao Yao, what are we going to do next? There’s still 12 hours left. We’re only halfway through this event and yet we only have 5000 people left….”
I smiled, “No problem, we still have the 20,000 from [Blood Contract]….”
Matcha said, “No, strictly speaking, [Blood Contract] only has 3000 people left….”
Shocked, I exclaimed, “What happened?”
Wan Er said, “Its because while we were fighting [Vanguard], [Blood Contract] was dealing with the attack from Ba Huang City’s NPC army. They managed to kill countless NPCs, but they themselves also suffered a lot of losses. You understand now, we have much too few people right now…..”
Dong Cheng said, “There’s another bit of news that is very saddening…”
I had a bad feeling, “What…”
Dong Cheng said, “[Hero’s Mound]’s main guild has set out…. Ten minutes ago, an army of around 40,000 players left Fna Shu City. They’ll reach Green Qilin Valley in around 70 minutes. We’re going to have to take on an even bigger battle…”
Wolf, “Looks like, this is going to be extremely hard….”
I gritted my teeth and said, “Alright, then we’ll just have to use a plan that isn’t a plan…”
“What plan?” Wan Er asked.
I stepped onto the thick ice and softly said, “Guard Green Qilin Abyss. You all know its terrain, and only a couple people can crawl down the vines at a time, or else if they were to try and jump down there, they would become a pile of meat sauce. Furthermore, there’s a lot of space at the bottom of the Abyss. It could hold 200 people at most. We’ll leave 200 of our elites in the Green Qilin Abyss to guard Chi Yu Han and Chi Yu Qing. Afterward…. Even if [Hero’s Mound] were to come, then we’ll rely on the terrain and kill as many as we can. As long as we can hold out for 12 more hours, then we’ll win. Other than the 200 people going to the abyss, the other 5000 will head north of the Glacial River Valley. Chi Yu Han and I will be enough to attract the firepower!”
