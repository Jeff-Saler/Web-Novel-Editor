Chapter 670 - 1v4
“After they have dispersed their formation, Li Xiao Yao will then attract the attention of both Enchanted Painting and Fang Ge Que. Qing Qian and I will rush forward to kill Chang Sheng Jue. Then, Li Xiao Yao will use [Ice Domain] and Dong Cheng will make Enchanted Painting fall asleep. After that, nobody touch her. Qing Qian, you stay at Enchanted Painting’s side. Stun anyone who tries to get close to her. We’ll focus our fire on Fan gGe Que. Pig, use your [Hands of Purgatory] to bind Enchanted Painting. We’ll bind her to death. After that, we’ll kill them off one by one. That should work….”
After Wan Er calmly organized the tactics, she warned, “Be careful. We need to watch out for Fang Ge Que’s [Lullaby] as well. Furthermore, his [God of Fire Formation] is just too strong. Darling Duck, save your [Anti-Magic Shield] as long as you can. Once Enchanted Painting activates her [Gorgeous Charm Dance], give them the [Anti-Magic Shield]. As long as they aren’t charmed then it’ll be fine. As long as we do this right, we’ll win!” 
Qing Qian and I nodded, “Yup, I know….” 
　　……
Once we set our battle plan, we activated our BUFFs during the countdown. Qing Qian and wWan Er had already disappeared into the wind. Our team’s advantage was in those two top assassins. They were extremely effective against weak classes. However, the fact that I was the only one to take damage was a disadvantage. This meant that I would be under a lot of pressure. 
“Shua…” 
My battle boots touched the ground. I was the first to charge out of the area. I swung my sword and threw a [Seven Star Fragment Slash], dealing a ranged attack. Even though Enchanted Painting didn’t have a chance to attack me. 
Fang Ge Que also waved his staff. [Flame Storm]+[Ice Rock Blast] exploded and my health plummeted. However, this time I had a healer on my side. Darling Duck used two [Heal]s to bring my health back. Lu Chun Yang and Enchanted Painting raised their swords and charged at Dong Cheng Yue. Their aim was to decrease our ranged attack and heals. Xuan Yuan Feng then picked up his spear and charged at me. Their tactics weren’t bad. They were gonna use an iron board to control my damage. Afterwards, they would kill us one by one. 
Right as Xuan Yuan Feng pulled close to me, I suddenly activated [Haste], increasing my movement exponentially. My feet slid and I made a perfect Z shape, passing by Xuan Yuan Feng. I had both swords in hand and dashed right at Enchanted Painting. I had to trap this girl, otherwise, Dong Cheng and Darling Duck would be in danger. 
Fang Ge Que saw that I wouldn’t use [Ice Domain], after all there weren’t any good ways to do this. Magic exploded at Darling Duck’s position. He had noticed that if Darling Duck didn’t die, there was no way to kill me. 
“Enchanted Painting, be careful. Xiao Yao’s target is you!” Fang Ge Que shouted. 
Enchanted Painting gave up pursuing the others and turned around to dash at me. Her blade sunk as she activated [Blade Rush], piercing through my body. At the same time, Dong Cheng’s [Thunderbolt Finger]+[Magma Lance] descended upon us. I immediately activated [Halberd Flame]. I swung both swords. And held off Enchanted Painting, Xuan Yuan Feng, and Lu Chun Yang’s attack. I used a [Sword Tempest] to counter. 
“No, don’t get caught in the AOE attack!” Fang Ge Que was starting to lose his cool. 
The second I was hit by [Charm], Enchanted Painting and Lu Chun Yang’s health had hit the bottom. I quickly gulped down a potion. However, there appeared to be two forces in the distant ruins. A fox shaped paw suddenly flew forward. On top of that, Wan Er used [Ice Pick Whirlpool]. Another two [Flying Dagger]s jumped out, dealing an attack from 30 yards away. At that moment, Enchanted Painting and Lu Chun Yang suddenly fell to their death. They had died too quickly. This was also the reason why Enchanted Painting finished her Combo so soon. If she didn’t use it soon, then she might not even have the chance to activate it. A team battle was the time for using your finishing skills. You don’t even need to think about it! 
With my last bit of health, I dealt a [Strength of a Thousand Men]. I had hacked Xuan Yuan Feng’s health down to critical. Before dying, I threw a [Great Realm of Desolation] onto Xuan Yuan Feng, decreasing the effect of his [Cleansing Wind] to 50% of its effectiveness. Dong Cheng then used another [Pillars of Ice and Fire] to kill him. 
I felt a shiver run through my body and I died. It was Fang Ge Que’s skill——[God of Fire Formation]. Even Dong Cheng and Darling Duck were wrapped into it. With one attack, he managed to kill two thin skins. 
Wan Er’s dagger flashed in the ruins. She had successfully activated [Gauge] and stunned him. She released a series of attacks at once to whittle down Fang Ge Que’s health while Qing Qian continued to stun Fang Ge Que. She skillfully maneuvered herself and threw another [Gouge] whenever the effects began to wear off. The two girls were practically in complete control. The second that his [Black Tortoise Shield] broke, the two girls switched to dealing combos one after another, instantly killing him. 
Dong Cheng supported them with magic coverage. After a few turns, Chang Sheng Jue also fell to his knees. 
　　1:0！
Who would have thought that [Zhan Long] would actually get the first win in this team battle! 
　　……
Standing on the stage, I said in the team chat——
I furrowed my brows and said, “I keep feeling like they didn’t fight at their full power… In other words, we managed to mess up Fang Ge Que’s rhythm. We can’t be too arrogant this next round. We have to fight at full power to get this round!” 
Qing Qian nodded, “Understood. We can do this team!” 
Wan Er didn’t say anything. She tightly gripped her dagger. She and Dong Cheng were both very nervous. After all, this was our one chance to have the honor of standing at the very summit of players in the Chinese Servers. Besides, our enemy this time was a team that has been called “Godly”. Thankfully, Little Demon wasn’t here. Otherwise, Little Demon would replace Lu Chun Yang and fight. If that were the case, we would’ve lost 3:1 already. 
In the second round, both sides faced each other in the battle arena. 
“Peng!” 
Xuan Yuan Feng rammed his shield into the ground before Fang Ge Que. It was as though a War God was guarding in front of his guildmaster. Enchanted Painting and Lu Chun Yang stood on either side of him. It was clear what they were planning. They were taking a defensive stance. Were they waiting for us to attack? 
Wan Er’s beautiful eyes stared at our opponents and she said, “Not good. Are they planning on using Xuan Yuan Feng’s armor and health for a battle of attrition?”
“A battle of attrition?” 
I smiled back. “Alright then. My [Blade Spin] has been thirsty for blood….” 
Dong Cheng said, “How should we fight then?” 
“Let’s stick with what we did before. We’ll kill Chang Sheng Jue first and then kill Fang Ge Que. First however, we have to break through the frontline that Xuan Yuan Feng and the others. Pig, you charge first. Qing Qian and I will provide support from the sides!” 
“Ok!” 
　　……
I raised my swords and charged forward. I threw a [Blade Spin] to ambush the opponent’s formation. Besides, these five aren’t newbies. Lu Chun Yang and Enchanted Painting both shifted to dodge the [Blade Spin]. Fang Ge Que didn’t move an inch. He could tell that the [Blade Spin]s trajectory slightly missed him…...
The moment we arrived before them, Xuan Yuan Feng suddenly opened up his [Dragon Armor]. After that, he pierced his long sword into the ground. At that moment, Wan Er shouted, “Not good!” 
[Earth Dragon Surge]
This S tier skill engulfed all three of us. Furthermore, it created a throwback effect. When I finally fell back on the ground, Fang Ge Que activated his [Fire and Ice Storm]. Furthermore, he had already prepared his [God of Fire Formation]! 
“Ah…” 
Qing Qian’s health emptied. Even after drinking a potion, she died. 
Wan Er clenched her teeth and dashed forward with [Blade of the Death God]. She spun around and broke through Enchanted Painting’s [Charm Dance]. The [Blade of the Death God] struck Fang Ge Que’s [Black Tortoise Shield]. At that same time, [Ice Pick Whirlpool]+[Flying Dagger] activated at the same time. I then threw a [Seven Star Fragment Slash]+[Sword Tempest] while Dong Cheng used her [Flame Beast Burstraid]+[Magma Lance]. Without Qing Qian’s [Grip of the Firefox], however, we couldn’t instantly kill Lu Chun Yang and Enchanted Painting. I quickly activated [Ice Domain]! 
“Peng!” 
Chang Sheng Jue dodged the attack with a [Anti-Magic Shield]. He had covered everyone in his group. The worst part was, the heal staff in his hand suddenly began to turn. A special skill was activating. A large green character flew up——[Aid Domain]. Fang Ge Que, Lu chun Yang, and Enchanted Painting’s critical health all recovered to 50%! 
It’s over...
As I predicted, Enchanted Painting used a [Combo] to kill Wan Er while Fang Ge Que used his [Lightning Eagle Wave] to quickly kill me. The three heavy armor players killed Dong Cheng and we were defeated. 
　　1:1！
Yet another match point. This fight for the championship was just too intense. 
　　……
“Shua shua….” 
For the last time, we appeared in the tournament room for this Hero’s Wing’s 2017 Cup. This was the last battle. This was the round that would determine who was the final champion of the Chinese Servers! 
Wan Er raised her dagger and said, “Not good. Xuan Yuan Feng, after buffing himself with [Dragon Armor] and [Body of war God], his defense is too high. He won’t budge a single inch. We have to find a new way to cut in. Dong Cheng, this time I’ll activate [Absolute Step] and [God’s Dance] and charge beside Pig. We’ll handle the three heavy armor players. Qing Qian, you use [Absolute Step] and kill Fang Ge Que. Use the element of surprise to stun Fang Ge Que. After that, everyone will focus on killing him. At least, we cannot let him use [God of Fire Formation]. Otherwise all will be too late….” 
Dong Cheng nodded, “Ok!” 
　　“3！”
　　“2！”
　　“1！”
The battle began! 
We split into three groups and spread out. I charged and rammed against Xuan Yuan Feng’s shield. I drove forward with all my strength, forcing him back a few steps. At the same time, I pierced my sword forward. “Keng!” I parried Enchanted Painting’s attack. This girl’s attack power was just too strong.She sprinted forward and rammed her leg against my wrist, canceling my attack and forcing me back. She didn’t let me anywhere near Fang Ge Que. However that was enough. I had already lured the two away. 
Qing Qian suddenly appeared among the crowd. She opened a palm, targeting her [Grip of the Firefox] on Fang Ge Que. However it missed. Fang Ge Que had used a [Dimensional Leap] in another direction. But right at that moment, he accidentally took Dong Cheng’s [Lullaby]!
Fang Ge Que was 20 yards out. Besides Chang Sheng Jue, nobody could reach him and so they couldn’t wake him. 
Wan Er quickly blocked Lu Chun Yang’s attack. She flew forward and threw a [Gouge], stunning Chang Sheng Jue. Afterwards she yelled, “[Hands of Purgatory]!” 
I opened my hand from a distance and successfully bound him! 
Wan Er and Qing Qian both charged towards Fang Ge Que. They had to kill him as soon as possible. 
Who knew that the moment Fang Ge Que awoke, he dealt a spell, escaping the [Hands of Purgatory]. He waved his hand at me. Blood red hands appeared below me, locking me to the ground. 
He then activated another [Dimensional Leap]. Fang Ge Que left a [Fire and Ice Storm] to deal with the two assassin girls. Lu Chun Yang and Enchanted Painting on the other hand charged at them while they still had the advantage, giving up on me. 
“We were tricked….” Qing Qian said in the team chat. 
Wan Er opened her iron umbrella to block Fang Ge Que’s attack and said, “Even if we die we have to take Fang Ge Que with us. Kill!” 
Dong Cheng also threw all of her spells forward. [Magma Lance], [Thunderbolt Finger] and [Flame Beast Burstraid] were all cast. Fang e Que actually managed to remain calm and throw a [Lullaby[ into the fray, causing Dong Cheng to fall asleep. Afterwards, he cast a [God of Fire Formation]. In the end, the second Wan Er’s [Blade of the Death God] exploded forth, the two girls died. 
We lost three people all at once. Fang Ge Que used his life to take the lives of two of our girls. Furthermore, he used a [Hands of Purgatory] to bind me and make Dong Cheng fall asleep. 
Enchanted Painting and Lu Chun Yang both charged at Dong Cheng. They didn’t wake her through hits. Rather, they waitd a few seconds. Afterwards they used [Break Armor Slash]+[Thunderclap Slash] and [Sword Break]+ Level 1 Combo, instantly killing our Dong Cheng. They didn’t even giver her a chance to counter. Xuan Yuan Feng then used a [Ram], stunning our Darling Duck. That plus two normal attacks from Enchanted Painting, even our healer was done for. 
It was 1v4 now in the arena. 
The [Hands of Purgatory] under my feet slowly disappeared and I could finally open my eyes. Frustration filled my heart. How was I supposed to fight?
