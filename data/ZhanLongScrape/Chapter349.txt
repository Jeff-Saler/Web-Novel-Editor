Chapter 349 Solo Exploration
In the Icy Forest Graveyard, a blizzard manifested.
As I traveled through the Icy Forest Graveyard with my Flaming Tiger God, a cluster of red dots appeared on the map. It seems like our intel was wrong. It looked like there were closer to 200 enemies, instead of the 100 previously reported. They were clearly all from [Zhan Long]’s enemy guilds. In reality, [Zhan Long] didn’t have many enemies, only [Hero Mound’s First Division] and [Mass Burial] amongst some others.
I lifted my sword and ran through the deep forest. After a few minutes, I came out of the forest into an open area. To my surprise, a large group of [Mass Burial] members were surrounding and attacking a few people. They were all wearing [Zhan Long’s First Division] badge. Their levels weren’t too high, around 61-65. One of the level 65 Berserkers was especially angry. With one axe strike, he killed an enemy Archer without even letting him shoot an arrow. He turned around and yelled, “Come on. Let’s see how many times you can kill us. I’ll trade a level for a level anyday. Breaking Dawn, protect Rainy. Kill as many as you can!”
This Berserker’s qualities weren’t bad. With his battle axe, he broke through attacks and killed another [Mass Burial] member, allowing me to see his stats above his head.
Wang Jiang Lv 65 Golden Berserker
Main City: Ba Huang City
Guild: [Zhan Long’s First Division]
Position: Chief
……
Wang Jiang lifted his battle axe and with a swing of his axe, he cut apart two Knights. Suddenly he was hit with around 7-8 arrows. His health disappeared as he stabbed his axe into the ground, “Sh*t. My health is dropping too fast. At this rate I’m going down again. You guys be careful!”
Behind Wang Jiang, a female Mage around 20 years old, activated [Indigo Sea Arrow] and killed an Archer. She followed up with [Pillar of Fire and Ice] and [Chilling Wind Spell]. This time she killed a Musketeer. Her ID was Rainy. I vaguely remembered her. She was an expert recruited by Wang Jian to join First Division. Not bad, having this kind of magic attack showed that she wasn’t any average Mage.
From the group of [Mass Burial] members, someone walked out of the fray. It was [Mass Burial]’s Guild Master, Not Ordinary. He lifted his axe and smiled, “I didn’t think that [Zhan Long’s First Division]’s weaklings would actually have someone like this. Hehe. It really gets me going. Brothers, let’s go and kill these people. Let’s send them to reunite with their friends in the graveyard. Kill that Rainy first. Don’t let her do too much damage to us.”
As he said that, Not Ordinary rushed forward with his axe. After dodging Wang Jiang’s attack, he fiercely rushed towards Rainy.
“Keng!”
With a loud sound, Rainy’s [Mana Shield] wore off. After quickly retreating, she used her ice magic to attack. Not Ordinary continued his barrage, but was parried by a level 63 Knight called Breaking Dawn. Breaking Dawn had already activated [Share Damage] on Rainy and a red aura surrounded Rainy. During the duration of this, all the damage Rainy received would be transferred onto Breaking Dawn. It was a special protection skill of a Knight.
“Bah!”
A group leader of [Mass Burial] spat on the ground, then smiled, “You guys want to defend against all the elites of [Mass Burial] with just you three? In your dreams! Let’s all attack together and kill them quickly. We still have to go venture deep into the Graveyard. Don’t let these [Zhan Long’s First Division] trash stand in our way!”
……
“Keng Keng Keng…..”
After being continuously attacked, Wang Jiang and Breaking Dawn retreated. They simply couldn’t hold on. It looked as though their opponents were playing with their prey. They could obviously end the battle and kill them, but the opposing Swordsmen continued to torture them. Wang Jiang and Breaking Dawn’s health were quickly dropping. It seemed like they couldn’t keep up anymore.
“Die!”
[Mass Burial]’s Lv 66 group leader, “Youyi” fiercely struck Breaking Dawn’s shield, sending him back a few steps. Youyi continued to fiercely kick him backwards, then looked at him with a cruel smirk and said, “Is [Zhan Long] really that strong? You noobs who only know how to follow the strong actually think that you’ll find protection after you join [Zhan Long’s First Division]? Let me tell you this, I don’t believe in that sh*t. We [Mass Burial] will rub [Zhan Long]’s tiger ass all we want. Let me tell you this, [Zhan Long] is only a weak mob and Xiao Yao Zi Zai is an idiot who only knows how to hug Cang Tong’s legs. Just keep hiding in [Zhan Long] until you die!”
Wang Jiang was infuriated and chugged down a 3000 health potion. He activated [Flame Axe] and [Skyshaker Slash], causing Youyi to stumble back. Wang Jiang’s young face twisted into an enraged expression, “Bullshit! We didn’t join [Zhan Long] to beg for their protection. We joined [Zhan Long] because the Guild Master respects each and every one of us; they make us feel like we are a big family. [Zhan Long] will never lose to a trash guild like yours!”
“Shua Shua Shua!”
A ray of holy light appeared as a group of Healers behind Youyi healed him quickly. He pointed his sword at Wang Jiang and laughed, “Too bad for you, the only ending for you guys is lying on the ground like dead dogs ….. Nothing will change this outcome…..”
As he finished talking, Youyi rushed forward with a series of attacks. Wang Jiang was in a critical state again!
“Katcha…..”
Sitting down with a thud behind a tree, Wang Jiang grabbed his axe with a defiant face and said, “Breaking Dawn, protect Rainy. We’ll keep on fighting…. keep on fighting……”
“Poor insects….. I almost feel too guilty stepping on all of you…..” Youyi swung his sword and activated [Skyshaker Slash]. This was going to be a fatal blow!
Wang Jiang was in critical state, his skills were all on cooldown, and his pet has already been killed. Even though there was no hope at all, he kept his eyes open. With his clear eyes, he stared at the members of [Mass Burial] and said, “Come on. You dumb [Mass Burial] members. Let’s see how you’ll kill me. One day, your daddy, I, will lead a group of brothers and return the favor by ten fold…….”
“Shua!”
“+1200！”
A fierce light appeared and Wang Jiang’s health raised. This was a third advancement Healer’s Lv 8 heal!
“Huh?”
Wong Jiang, Breaking Dawn, and Rainy all lifted their heads. At this moment, a glimmer of hope flashed in their eyes, especially in Rainy’s who was unable to do anything. She shuddered and almost cried as she stuttered, “Xiao Yao…… Zi Zai….. The Guild Master. Our Guild Master is here. Guild Master is here…..”
“Bang!”
Coming out from the snow, I cast [Haste] to increase my speed. With my Emperor Qin’s Sword and Cold Iron Sword, I landed three strikes on Youyi’s chest.
“2461！”
“2726！”
“2747！”
Youyi’s reactions were not too slow as he chugged down a Lv 9 potion in between. His face became twisted as he looked at me, “Xiao Yao Zi Zai! Sh*t! Why is he here?!?”
I clenched my fists and said, “Bullying members of my [Zhan Long], you’ll be punished!”
“Boom!”
[Great Realm of Desolation] exploded and pierced through Youyi’s body, dealing a great amount of damage.
“9024！”
……
As Youyi fell, his face still showed signs of shock, “F*ck. Xiao Yao Zai Zai is here….. Brothers, gang up on them. They only have four people. There’s nothing to be afraid of!”
Emperor Qin’s Sword moaned slightly and my Cold Iron Sword started to grow colder as I swung both swords. My cape fluttered behind me as Flaming Tiger God stood next to me. I looked forward and said to the three people behind me, “Wang Jiang, Breaking Dawn, protect Rainy. Leave the rest to me. You guys have fought hard. You can rest for a bit now…..”
Wang Jiang nodded: “Okay. Be careful Guild Master!”
……
On the other side, an Archer leader yelled, “Let’s go! Shoot your [Scattered Shots] together. They only have one Xiao Yao Zi Zai. There’s nothing to be afraid of. Kill him!”
Those who make the first strike will punish those who don’t!
I didn’t make a sound as I rushed forward 10 meters. With a wave of Emperor Qin’s Sword, seven stars appeared. [Seven Star Fragment Slash] slashed down and heavily injured their group. It even killed quite a few people. Flaming Tiger God roared and used [Burstfire Raid], causing endless cries of pain.
I turned around and a number of melee players rushed over!
I couldn’t help but laugh. With both of my swords, I rushed into the group of people. My Emperor Qin’s Sword shook as I stabbed into a Swordsman’s chest and I spun my Cold Iron Sword to parry a Berserker’s axe. My body was rapidly whirling as I danced through the group of players with my twin swords and attacked them. With my defense, I didn’t have to worry about their attacks. The two swords were soon drenched in blood. After I swiftly killed that Archer, I was able to push forward with both swords.
“Pssh!”
“5772！”
A Lv 64 third advancement Swordsman stood there with a shocked face. He was easily killed in a single hit. He probably thought that he would be able to withstand at least one of my attacks. 10 corpses were scattered behind me while I was back at full health due to my 10% lifesteal effect.
“F*ck………”
A [Mass Burial] team leader Knight cursed coldly, “This kind of attack power and attack speed is too damn strong already and he also has lifesteal? Is Xiao Yao Zi Zai invincible? Third bro, Fifth bro, come with me. Let’s kill him!”
He brought two Assassins and rushed forward. The Assassins activated [Absolute Step] and [God’s Dance] at the same time. Their speed exploded. This was a tactic to stun and kill me.
“Shua!”
The Assassin on the right quickly lifted his dagger and activated [Gouge].
I quickly reacted and swung my Cold Iron Sword. “Keng.” His dagger was parried by my sword and [Gouge] was broken. I attacked with my Emperor Qin’s Sword and killed him. With my Cold Iron Sword, I swung behind me and stabbed the other Assassin. He quickly fell to the ground as well. After quickly finishing the two Assassins, I fiercely glared at the Knight. With both swords, I struck him five times consecutively until he knelt to the ground with widened eyes.
……
“Boom Boom Boom…..”
In the distance, I noticed that bursts of flames were flying at me. There were at least 30+ Mages controlling magic. Without even realizing, I was down to around 50% health from these fire attacks.
I lifted my arms and two God’s Army Cards activated and [Soul’s Army] slowly descended. At the same time, I activated [Seven Star Teleportation] allowing me to teleport towards them. I activated [Seven Star Fragment Slash] along with my Flaming Tiger God’s [Burstfire Raid]. The group of Mages cried out desperately from suffering the barrage of attacks. Without letting them cast another spell, I teleported again. With Flaming Tiger God’s [Flame Armor], we easily killed the group of Mages, not sparing a single one.
……
“Splash!”
Wang Jiang’s eyes widened. Looking at the chaotic situation, he gulped and said, “Breaking Dawn, This…. This is the strength of [Zhan Long]’s strongest player? It’s…… It’s too terrifying….”
Breaking Dawn lifted his sword, “Yeah!”
Rainy’s jaw dropped, “So strong… the Guild Master is really strong…. only one person…..”
